## Who I am

Hi! My name is **Ryan Nguyen** (known as **wache** online) and I'm currently studying computer science at San Jose State University. I'm a software engineer with a deep passion for building tools that make developers' lives easier and more productive.

## What drives me

I'm deeply interested in several areas that I believe will shape the future of technology and society:

  <Card title="Startups" icon="rocket">
    I love the fast-paced, innovative environment of startups where you can ship quickly, wear many hats, and see your work make an immediate impact on real users.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI augmentation" icon="robot">
    I believe in AI as a tool for augmentation rather than replacement - technology that enhances human capabilities and helps us accomplish more, not technology that replaces human involvement entirely.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Developer tools" icon="wrench">
    Building tools that help other developers be more productive is incredibly rewarding. There's something special about creating software that makes other software engineers more effective at their craft.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Environmental impact" icon="leaf">
    I care deeply about sustainability and believe that technology can and should be a force for positive environmental change. I'm always thinking about how my work can contribute to a more sustainable future.

## My approach to software engineering

I believe in building software that is:

- **Practical**: Software should solve real problems that people actually have, not theoretical issues that sound impressive but don't matter in practice.
- **User-focused**: The best technology is invisible to its users - it just works and helps them accomplish their goals without getting in the way.
- **Well-crafted**: While speed matters, quality matters too. I strive to write code that is clean, maintainable, and built to last.
- **Innovative**: I'm always looking for new and better ways to solve problems, whether that means adopting new technologies or reimagining existing approaches.

## Current focus

Right now, I'm working as a **Backend AI Engineer at Mintlify**, where I build and ship core product features and new AI capabilities. I work across the full product surface, contributing to both existing features and greenfield AI projects. It's an incredible experience working at a dev tools startup - shipping fast, wearing many hats, and building AI features that developers actually use every day.

## Let's connect!

I'm always interested in chatting about new technologies, startups, photography, or really anything at all! Don't hesitate to reach out - I love meeting new people and exchanging ideas.
