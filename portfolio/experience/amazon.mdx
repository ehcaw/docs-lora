## Overview

During my internship at Amazon, I worked on the Amazon Search team, specifically within the Search Data Platform organization. My primary project involved building a comprehensive feature lineage system for the Offline Feature Store, a critical component of Amazon's search infrastructure that handles feature engineering and management at massive scale.

## The challenge

The Offline Feature Store manages thousands of features used across Amazon Search. As the number of features grew, teams faced increasing difficulty understanding:

- How features were transformed from raw data to their final form
- Which upstream changes might affect downstream features
- The dependencies between different features and data sources

Without proper lineage tracking, debugging issues, ensuring data quality, and managing feature deprecation became increasingly complex challenges.

## What I built

To address these challenges, I designed and implemented a complete feature lineage system with several key components:

### Parsing algorithm and data model

I developed a sophisticated parsing algorithm that could analyze feature transformation definitions and extract lineage information automatically. This included:

- Parsing complex transformation logic to identify upstream dependencies
- Building a graph-based data model to represent feature relationships
- Handling edge cases like circular dependencies and indirect transformations

### Automated CI/CD pipeline

To ensure lineage information stayed current, I constructed a fully automated CI/CD pipeline that:

- Automatically refreshes lineage data whenever feature models are updated
- Validates lineage integrity before deployment
- Notifies teams of significant changes to their feature dependencies

### Scala API

I created a robust Scala API that allows teams to programmatically query feature lineage information, enabling:

- Impact analysis before making changes to features
- Automated documentation generation
- Integration with existing monitoring and alerting systems

### Visualization dashboard

To make lineage information accessible to non-technical stakeholders, I built a Next.js dashboard featuring:

- Interactive D3.js visualizations of feature lineage graphs
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Drill-down views for detailed dependency analysis

## Impact and learnings

This internship was an incredible learning experience that exposed me to systems operating at Amazon scale. Key takeaways include:

1. **Systems at scale require different thinking** - Solutions that work for small datasets often fail catastrophically at Amazon's scale. Learning to think about performance, reliability, and cost from the beginning was crucial. At Amazon, even minor inefficiencies can translate to massive costs or performance degradation when multiplied across billions of operations.

2. **Observability is essential** - In complex distributed systems, you can't improve what you can't measure. Building comprehensive lineage tracking is a form of observability that pays dividends in debugging, compliance, and operational efficiency. When something goes wrong in a distributed system, having the right visibility into data flows and dependencies can mean the difference between a quick fix and days of investigation.

3. **Cross-team collaboration** - Building infrastructure that serves multiple teams requires careful API design, clear documentation, and proactive communication. I learned to design APIs that are both powerful enough for advanced users and intuitive enough for teams to adopt without extensive onboarding. Getting buy-in from stakeholders and understanding their pain points was just as important as the technical implementation.

4. **Impact through tooling** - Developer productivity tools and infrastructure improvements can have outsized impact by improving the efficiency of entire organizations. A single tool that saves each developer 10 minutes a day can translate to thousands of engineering hours saved annually across Amazon.

5. **Amazon's leadership principles in practice** - Working at Amazon exposed me to their leadership principles in action. "Dive Deep" and "Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit" were particularly relevant—I had to really understand the technical details to make informed decisions, and I learned to advocate for my ideas while remaining open to feedback and course correction.
