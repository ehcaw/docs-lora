## Overview

During my internship at Amazon, I worked on the Amazon Search team, specifically within the Search Data Platform organization. My primary project involved building a comprehensive feature lineage system for the Offline Feature Store, a critical component of Amazon's search infrastructure that handles feature engineering and management at massive scale.

## The challenge

The Offline Feature Store manages thousands of features used across Amazon Search. As the number of features grew, teams faced increasing difficulty understanding:

- How features were transformed from raw data to their final form
- Which upstream changes might affect downstream features
- The dependencies between different features and data sources

Without proper lineage tracking, debugging issues, ensuring data quality, and managing feature deprecation became increasingly complex challenges.

## What I built

To address these challenges, I designed and implemented a complete feature lineage system with several key components:

### Parsing algorithm and data model

I developed a sophisticated parsing algorithm that could analyze feature transformation definitions and extract lineage information automatically. This included:

- Parsing complex transformation logic to identify upstream dependencies
- Building a graph-based data model to represent feature relationships
- Handling edge cases like circular dependencies and indirect transformations

### Automated CI/CD pipeline

To ensure lineage information stayed current, I constructed a fully automated CI/CD pipeline that:

- Automatically refreshes lineage data whenever feature models are updated
- Validates lineage integrity before deployment
- Notifies teams of significant changes to their feature dependencies

### Scala API

I created a robust Scala API that allows teams to programmatically query feature lineage information, enabling:

- Impact analysis before making changes to features
- Automated documentation generation
- Integration with existing monitoring and alerting systems

### Visualization dashboard

To make lineage information accessible to non-technical stakeholders, I built a Next.js dashboard featuring:

- Interactive D3.js visualizations of feature lineage graphs
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Drill-down views for detailed dependency analysis

## Impact and learnings

This internship was an incredible learning experience that exposed me to systems operating at Amazon scale. The sheer magnitude of data processed by Amazon Search is humbling, and working within that context taught me lessons that fundamentally changed how I think about software engineering.

1. **Systems at scale require different thinking** - Solutions that work for small datasets often fail catastrophically at Amazon's scale. I learned to think about performance, reliability, and cost from the very beginning of any design process. Assumptions that seem reasonable at small scale can become critical bottlenecks when dealing with millions of features and billions of data points.

2. **Observability is essential** - In complex distributed systems, you can't improve what you can't measure. Building comprehensive lineage tracking is a form of observability that pays dividends in debugging, compliance, and operational efficiency. The feature lineage system I built has helped teams understand the impact of changes before they propagate through the system.

3. **Cross-team collaboration** - Building infrastructure that serves multiple teams requires careful API design, clear documentation, and proactive communication. I learned the importance of understanding different teams' workflows and requirements, and designing systems that are flexible enough to accommodate diverse use cases.

4. **Impact through tooling** - Developer productivity tools and infrastructure improvements can have outsized impact by improving the efficiency of entire organizations. The lineage system touched multiple teams and workflows, demonstrating how infrastructure investments compound over time.
