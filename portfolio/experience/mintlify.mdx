# Backend AI Engineer

<Info>
  **Company:** Mintlify  
  **Period:** 2025 - Present  
  **Location:** San Francisco, CA
</Info>

## Overview

At Mintlify, I work across the entire product surface as a backend AI engineer, contributing to both existing features and greenfield AI projects. Mintlify is a developer-focused company that builds beautiful documentation platforms, and being part of this team has been an incredible opportunity to combine my passion for developer tools with cutting-edge AI development.

## What I do

My role at Mintlify is multifaceted, involving both core backend engineering work and the development of new AI-powered features. On any given day, I might be:

- **Building backend services** that power Mintlify's documentation platform, ensuring they are reliable, scalable, and performant
- **Developing new AI features** that fundamentally change how users create and interact with documentation
- **Working across the full product surface**, contributing wherever my skills can have the most impact
- **Collaborating with the team** to ship AI-powered tools that make documentation smarter and more useful for developers everywhere

## Technologies I work with

## What I've learned

Working at a dev tools startup has taught me invaluable lessons about building products that developers actually want to use:

1. **Ship fast and iterate** - In a startup environment, speed matters. Getting features in front of users quickly and iterating based on feedback is crucial for success. You can't afford to spend months perfecting something before getting it into users' hands—you need to validate assumptions quickly and adjust course based on real-world usage patterns.

2. **Wear many hats** - At a smaller company, you have the opportunity (and responsibility) to contribute across different areas. This has helped me grow as a well-rounded engineer. One day I might be working on backend API design, the next I'm debugging a frontend issue or helping with infrastructure decisions. This versatility has been incredibly valuable for my growth as an engineer.

3. **Build AI features that matter** - Not every problem needs an AI solution, but when AI is the right tool, it can create magical user experiences. Learning to identify where AI adds genuine value has been a key skill. The best AI features are those that augment human capabilities rather than trying to replace human judgment entirely.

4. **Developer experience is paramount** - Building tools for developers means having empathy for their workflows, pain points, and expectations. Good developer tools feel invisible—they just work. Developers are a notoriously demanding audience, and rightfully so—they spend all day using tools, so every friction point is amplified across thousands of interactions.

5. **Cross-functional collaboration** - Working at a startup means collaborating closely with product managers, designers, and other engineers. Understanding different perspectives and communicating effectively across disciplines is essential for shipping great products.
