# Backend AI Engineer

<Info>
  **Company:** Mintlify  
  **Period:** 2025 - Present  
  **Location:** San Francisco, CA
</Info>

## Overview

At Mintlify, I work across the entire product surface as a backend AI engineer, contributing to both existing features and greenfield AI projects. Mintlify is a developer-focused company that builds beautiful documentation platforms, and being part of this team has been an incredible opportunity to combine my passion for developer tools with cutting-edge AI development. The company is at the intersection of two things I care deeply about: making developers more productive and leveraging AI to create genuinely useful tools.

## What I do

My role at Mintlify is multifaceted, involving both core backend engineering work and the development of new AI-powered features that are transforming how developers create, maintain, and interact with documentation. On any given day, I might be:

- **Building and maintaining backend services** that power Mintlify's documentation platform, ensuring they are reliable, scalable, and performant for thousands of developers and companies relying on the platform
- **Developing new AI features** that fundamentally change how users create and interact with documentation—from intelligent content suggestions to automated documentation generation
- **Working across the full product surface**, contributing wherever my skills can have the most impact, whether that's infrastructure improvements, API design, or user-facing features
- **Collaborating with the team** to ship AI-powered tools that make documentation smarter and more useful for developers everywhere, participating in design discussions, code reviews, and product planning

## Technologies I work with

In my role, I regularly work with a diverse and evolving technology stack that spans modern web development, AI/ML, and cloud infrastructure:

## What I've learned

Working at a dev tools startup has taught me invaluable lessons about building products that developers actually want to use. These lessons have shaped how I approach engineering problems and product development:

1. **Ship fast and iterate** - In a startup environment, speed matters. Getting features in front of users quickly and iterating based on feedback is crucial for success. The best way to learn what users need is to put something in their hands and watch how they use it. Mintlify moves fast, and I've learned to balance velocity with quality.

2. **Wear many hats** - At a smaller company, you have the opportunity (and responsibility) to contribute across different areas. This has helped me grow as a well-rounded engineer. One day I might be deep in backend infrastructure, the next I'm contributing to AI prompts, and the next I'm debugging a customer issue. This variety keeps the work interesting and broadens my skill set.

3. **Build AI features that matter** - Not every problem needs an AI solution, but when AI is the right tool, it can create magical user experiences. Learning to identify where AI adds genuine value has been a key skill. The goal isn't to add AI for the sake of it, but to use AI where it genuinely makes users' lives easier and their documentation better.

4. **Developer experience is paramount** - Building tools for developers means having empathy for their workflows, pain points, and expectations. Good developer tools feel invisible—they just work. Developers are discerning users who notice when tools are slow, clunky, or don't integrate well with their existing workflows.

5. **Working in the open** - Mintlify values transparency and working in the open. This means clear communication, documented decisions, and a culture where questions are welcomed. It's taught me the value of over-communicating and making my work visible to the team.
