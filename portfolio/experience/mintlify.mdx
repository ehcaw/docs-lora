# Backend AI Engineer

<Info>
  **Company:** Mintlify  
  **Period:** 2025 - Present  
  **Location:** San Francisco, CA
</Info>

## Overview

At Mintlify, I work across the entire product surface as a backend AI engineer, contributing to both existing features and greenfield AI projects. Mintlify is a developer-focused company that builds beautiful documentation platforms, and being part of this team has been an incredible opportunity to combine my passion for developer tools with cutting-edge AI development.

## What I do

My role at Mintlify is multifaceted, involving both core backend engineering work and the development of new AI-powered features. On any given day, I might be:

- **Building backend services** that power Mintlify's documentation platform, ensuring they are reliable, scalable, and performant
- **Developing new AI features** that fundamentally change how users create and interact with documentation
- **Working across the full product surface**, contributing wherever my skills can have the most impact
- **Collaborating with the team** to ship AI-powered tools that make documentation smarter and more useful for developers everywhere

## What I've learned

Working at a dev tools startup has taught me invaluable lessons about building products that developers actually want to use:

1. **Ship fast and iterate** - In a startup environment, speed matters. Getting features in front of users quickly and iterating based on feedback is crucial for success.

2. **Wear many hats** - At a smaller company, you have the opportunity (and responsibility) to contribute across different areas. This has helped me grow as a well-rounded engineer.

3. **Build AI features that matter** - Not every problem needs an AI solution, but when AI is the right tool, it can create magical user experiences. Learning to identify where AI adds genuine value has been a key skill.

4. **Developer experience is paramount** - Building tools for developers means having empathy for their workflows, pain points, and expectations. Good developer tools feel invisible—they just work.
