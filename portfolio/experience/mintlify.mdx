# Backend AI Engineer

<Info>
  **Company:** Mintlify  
  **Period:** 2025 - Present  
  **Location:** San Francisco, CA
</Info>

## Overview

At Mintlify, I work across the entire product surface as a backend AI engineer, contributing to both existing features and greenfield AI projects. Mintlify is a developer-focused company that builds beautiful documentation platforms, and being part of this team has been an incredible opportunity to combine my passion for developer tools with cutting-edge AI development.

## What I do

My role at Mintlify is multifaceted, involving both core backend engineering work and the development of new AI-powered features. On any given day, I might be:

- **Building backend services** that power Mintlify's documentation platform, ensuring they are reliable, scalable, and performant
- **Developing new AI features** that fundamentally change how users create and interact with documentation
- **Working across the full product surface**, contributing wherever my skills can have the most impact
- **Collaborating with the team** to ship AI-powered tools that make documentation smarter and more useful for developers everywhere

## Technologies I work with

## What I've learned

Working at a dev tools startup has taught me invaluable lessons about building products that developers actually want to use. The fast-paced environment, combined with the close proximity to users and their feedback, has accelerated my growth as an engineer in ways that would be difficult to replicate in a larger organization.

1. **Ship fast and iterate** - In a startup environment, speed matters enormously. Getting features in front of users quickly and iterating based on their real-world feedback is crucial for success. I've learned to embrace uncertainty and trust that rapid iteration will lead us to better solutions than extensive upfront planning alone.

2. **Wear many hats** - At a smaller company, you have the opportunity (and responsibility) to contribute across different areas of the product. This has helped me grow as a well-rounded engineer, giving me exposure to everything from backend infrastructure to AI model integration to user-facing features.

3. **Build AI features that matter** - Not every problem needs an AI solution, but when AI is the right tool, it can create magical user experiences. Learning to identify where AI adds genuine value—rather than adding it just because it's trendy—has been a key skill that I continue to develop with every feature I ship.

4. **Developer experience is paramount** - Building tools for developers means having empathy for their workflows, pain points, and expectations. Good developer tools feel invisible—they just work. This principle guides every design decision I make, from API interfaces to error messages to documentation.
