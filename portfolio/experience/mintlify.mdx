## Overview

<Info>
**Position**: Backend AI Engineer  
**Company**: Mintlify  
**Duration**: 2025 - Present
</Info>

At Mintlify, I work across the entire product as a backend AI engineer, focusing on building and shipping both core product features and cutting-edge AI capabilities. Mintlify is a documentation platform that helps developers create beautiful, intelligent documentation experiences, and my role involves making those docs smarter and more useful through AI integration.

## What I do

My day-to-day work involves a diverse mix of backend engineering and AI development. I contribute to the full product surface, meaning I touch everything from existing features that need enhancement to brand new AI-powered capabilities that are being built from scratch. This variety keeps the work interesting and allows me to have a broad impact on how the platform evolves.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Backend services development">
    I build and maintain the backend services that power Mintlify's documentation platform. This includes everything from API endpoints to data processing pipelines, ensuring that the platform is reliable, performant, and scalable as we grow our user base.
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI feature development">
    A significant portion of my work involves developing new AI features that enhance how users create and interact with documentation. This includes intelligent content suggestions, automated documentation generation, semantic search capabilities, and other AI-powered tools that make documentation more useful.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Full product contribution">
    I work across the entire product surface, contributing to both existing features and greenfield AI projects. This means I'm involved in feature planning, architecture decisions, implementation, and iteration based on user feedback.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Team collaboration">
    I collaborate closely with the team to ship AI-powered tools that make documentation smarter and more useful. Working at a startup means tight feedback loops with colleagues and users, which helps us iterate quickly on ideas.

## Impact and growth

Working at a dev tools startup has been an incredible learning experience. The environment demands that you ship fast, wear many hats, and take ownership of features from conception to deployment. Some of the key aspects of this experience include:

- **Fast iteration cycles**: At a startup, you don't have the luxury of long development cycles. Features need to ship quickly, get validated by users, and be iterated upon rapidly. This has sharpened my ability to make good technical decisions under time pressure.

- **Cross-functional exposure**: Being at a smaller company means I get exposure to areas beyond just my core role. I've learned about product strategy, user research, and go-to-market considerations that I wouldn't have been exposed to at a larger company.

- **Direct user impact**: The features I build are used by developers every day. There's a direct line between my work and the value it provides to users, which is incredibly motivating.

- **AI at the forefront**: Mintlify is deeply invested in AI capabilities, which means I'm working on the cutting edge of what's possible with AI in developer tools. This is an exciting space to be in as the technology continues to evolve rapidly.

## Reflection

<Note>
Working at a dev tools startup has been an incredible experience — shipping fast, wearing many hats, and building AI features that developers actually use every day. The combination of impactful work, rapid learning, and working with a talented team makes this role incredibly rewarding.
