# Full-Stack Developer

<Info>
  **Company:** The Tutoring Center  
  **Period:** 2024 - 2025  
  **Location:** San Jose, CA
</Info>

## Overview

At The Tutoring Center, I worked as a full-stack developer responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining web applications that streamlined the management of tutoring sessions and student records. This role gave me my first deep experience working directly with customers and stakeholders to understand their needs and translate them into functional software.

## What I did

My responsibilities at The Tutoring Center spanned the entire software development lifecycle:

### Built responsive web applications

I developed web applications from initial concept through to production deployment, ensuring they worked flawlessly across devices and screen sizes. This included:

- Designing intuitive user interfaces that non-technical staff could use with minimal training
- Implementing responsive layouts that worked on desktop computers, tablets, and mobile devices
- Building features for scheduling, student tracking, and progress reporting

### Collaborated with stakeholders

One of the most valuable aspects of this role was the close collaboration with key stakeholders. I regularly:

- Met with tutoring center managers to understand their operational pain points
- Gathered requirements from tutors and administrative staff
- Translated business needs into technical specifications
- Iterated on designs based on user feedback

### Maintained and optimized the codebase

Beyond building new features, I also took ownership of maintaining and improving existing systems:

- Refactored legacy code to improve maintainability and performance
- Implemented automated testing to catch bugs before they reached production
- Optimized database queries to improve application responsiveness
- Documented code and processes to help future developers

### Technical planning and architecture

As the primary developer, I participated in technical planning and architecture decisions that shaped the direction of the platform:

- Evaluated new technologies and frameworks for potential adoption
- Designed database schemas to efficiently store and retrieve student data
- Planned feature rollouts to minimize disruption to daily operations

## Key learnings

This role was transformative in teaching me how to develop software with real users in mind. It was my first experience working with customers so intimately, and the lessons I learned have shaped how I approach every project since.

1. **Customer empathy is crucial** - Understanding the daily challenges faced by tutors and administrators helped me build features that actually solved their problems, rather than features I thought were technically interesting. Sitting with users and watching them work revealed pain points that I never would have discovered through requirements documents alone.

2. **Communication is a skill** - Explaining technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders and translating their needs into actionable requirements are skills that require practice and intentionality. I learned to speak in terms of outcomes and benefits rather than technical implementation details.

3. **Simplicity wins** - The best features are often the simplest ones. Users don't want to learn complex interfaces—they want software that gets out of their way and lets them do their job. Every feature I built had to earn its complexity, and I often found that simpler solutions were not only easier to build but also more effective.

4. **Feedback loops matter** - Regularly checking in with users and iterating based on their feedback led to much better outcomes than trying to anticipate every need upfront. I learned to develop with customer needs and pain points in mind, treating user feedback as the most valuable input to the development process.
