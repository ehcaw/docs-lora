## Overview

<Info>
**Position**: Full-Stack Developer  
**Company**: The Tutoring Center  
**Duration**: 2024 - 2025
</Info>

At The Tutoring Center, I worked as a full-stack developer responsible for developing and maintaining web applications that help manage tutoring sessions and student records. This role gave me valuable experience working directly with customers and stakeholders to understand their needs and translate those into functional software solutions.

## What I built

The primary focus of my work was building responsive web applications that served the operational needs of the tutoring center. This included systems for scheduling sessions, tracking student progress, managing tutor assignments, and generating reports for administrative purposes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Concept to deployment">
    I built responsive web applications from the initial concept phase all the way through to deployment. This meant being involved in requirements gathering, design discussions, implementation, testing, and finally deploying to production environments.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stakeholder collaboration">
    A key aspect of this role was working closely with key stakeholders - administrators, tutors, and sometimes parents - to fully understand and implement their requirements. This involved regular meetings, feedback sessions, and iterative development based on real-world usage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Codebase maintenance">
    In addition to building new features, I maintained and optimized the existing codebase. This included refactoring legacy code, improving performance, fixing bugs, and ensuring the system remained reliable and responsive as usage grew.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Technical planning">
    I participated in technical planning and architecture decisions, helping to shape how the system would evolve over time. This included evaluating new technologies, planning database schemas, and designing API structures.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Technical stack

The applications I worked on used a modern JavaScript/TypeScript stack that enabled rapid development while maintaining code quality:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Frontend" icon="desktop">
    - **Next.js** for server-side rendering and routing
    - **React** for building interactive user interfaces
    - **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
  </Card>
  <Card title="Backend & Database" icon="database">
    - **Supabase** for backend-as-a-service
    - PostgreSQL database with real-time subscriptions
    - Row-level security for data protection
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Why this stack worked

<Accordion title="Next.js and React">
  Next.js provided an excellent framework for building the application, offering server-side rendering for better performance and SEO, file-based routing for easy navigation structure, and API routes for backend functionality. Combined with React's component model, it allowed for building reusable UI components that could be easily maintained and extended.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="TypeScript">
  Using TypeScript throughout the codebase caught many bugs at compile time rather than runtime. This was especially valuable when working with complex data structures like student records and scheduling information, where type safety prevented many potential issues.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Supabase">
  Supabase provided a complete backend solution including authentication, database, and real-time subscriptions. This allowed me to focus on building features rather than infrastructure, while still having the flexibility to write custom queries when needed.
</Accordion>

## Customer-focused development

One of the most valuable aspects of this role was the close interaction with customers. Unlike working at a large company where users are often abstracted behind product managers and analytics dashboards, at The Tutoring Center I worked directly with the people who would use the software every day.

### Understanding real needs

This direct contact taught me important lessons about customer-focused development:

- **Listen before building**: Users often describe symptoms rather than root causes. Taking time to understand the underlying problem before jumping to solutions leads to better outcomes.

- **Iterate based on feedback**: Features that seemed perfect in planning often needed adjustment once real users started using them. Building in time for iteration was essential.

- **Prioritize pain points**: Not all features are equally valuable. Learning to identify which problems cause the most friction helped prioritize development efforts effectively.

- **Communicate clearly**: Technical capabilities and limitations need to be explained in terms non-technical stakeholders can understand and evaluate.

## Impact and outcomes

The applications I built and maintained had direct, tangible impacts on daily operations:

- **Improved scheduling efficiency**: The scheduling system reduced the time needed to organize tutoring sessions, allowing staff to focus more on student success rather than administrative work.

- **Better progress tracking**: Comprehensive tracking of student progress made it easier to identify students who needed additional support and to demonstrate value to parents.

- **Reduced administrative overhead**: Automating routine tasks like report generation and attendance tracking freed up staff time for more valuable activities.

## Reflection

<Note>
This role was my first experience working with customers so intimately, and I learned how to develop with customer needs and pain points in mind. Understanding that software exists to solve real problems for real people shaped how I approach development to this day.
</Note>

The experience of building software that directly impacts people's daily work was deeply rewarding. Every feature shipped was an opportunity to make someone's job a little easier or more effective. This customer-centric mindset continues to influence how I approach software development.
