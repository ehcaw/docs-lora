# Full-Stack Developer

<Info>
  **Company:** The Tutoring Center  
  **Period:** 2024 - 2025  
  **Location:** San Jose, CA
</Info>

## Overview

At The Tutoring Center, I worked as a full-stack developer responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining web applications that streamlined the management of tutoring sessions and student records. This role gave me my first deep experience working directly with customers and stakeholders to understand their needs and translate them into functional software.

## What I did

My responsibilities at The Tutoring Center spanned the entire software development lifecycle:

### Built responsive web applications

I developed web applications from initial concept through to production deployment, ensuring they worked flawlessly across devices and screen sizes. This included:

- Designing intuitive user interfaces that non-technical staff could use with minimal training
- Implementing responsive layouts that worked on desktop computers, tablets, and mobile devices
- Building features for scheduling, student tracking, and progress reporting

### Collaborated with stakeholders

One of the most valuable aspects of this role was the close collaboration with key stakeholders. I regularly:

- Met with tutoring center managers to understand their operational pain points
- Gathered requirements from tutors and administrative staff
- Translated business needs into technical specifications
- Iterated on designs based on user feedback

### Maintained and optimized the codebase

Beyond building new features, I also took ownership of maintaining and improving existing systems:

- Refactored legacy code to improve maintainability and performance
- Implemented automated testing to catch bugs before they reached production
- Optimized database queries to improve application responsiveness
- Documented code and processes to help future developers

### Technical planning and architecture

As the primary developer, I participated in technical planning and architecture decisions that shaped the direction of the platform:

- Evaluated new technologies and frameworks for potential adoption
- Designed database schemas to efficiently store and retrieve student data
- Planned feature rollouts to minimize disruption to daily operations

## Key learnings

This role was transformative in teaching me how to develop software with real users in mind:

1. **Customer empathy is crucial** - Understanding the daily challenges faced by tutors and administrators helped me build features that actually solved their problems, rather than features I thought were technically interesting. I spent time shadowing tutors and administrative staff to understand their workflows, frustrations, and unspoken needs. This observational approach revealed pain points that users themselves couldn't always articulate.

2. **Communication is a skill** - Explaining technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders and translating their needs into actionable requirements are skills that require practice and intentionality. I learned to speak in terms of outcomes and benefits rather than technical implementation details, which helped build trust and ensured we were always aligned on priorities.

3. **Simplicity wins** - The best features are often the simplest ones. Users don't want to learn complex interfaces—they want software that gets out of their way and lets them do their job. I developed an appreciation for the invisible design work that goes into making things feel effortless. Every additional button, option, or step is a potential friction point.

4. **Feedback loops matter** - Regularly checking in with users and iterating based on their feedback led to much better outcomes than trying to anticipate every need upfront. I established weekly check-ins with key stakeholders to gather feedback and demo new features, which created a collaborative development process that resulted in software people actually loved using.

5. **Technical debt management** - Working on a real production system taught me the importance of balancing speed with code quality. Sometimes you need to ship quickly to meet a deadline, but you also need to allocate time for refactoring and paying down technical debt before it becomes unmanageable.
