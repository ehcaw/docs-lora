## Overview

<Info>
**Project**: Delta  
**Status**: In Development  
**Repository**: [github.com/ehcaw/delta](https://github.com/ehcaw/delta)
</Info>

Delta is a personal finance tracker that uses AI vision to parse screenshots of bank statements, credit card apps, and investment accounts. Instead of manually entering transactions or connecting your accounts to third-party services, just screenshot your accounts and let AI do the data entry.

## The problem with finance tracking

Keeping track of personal finances is important but tedious:

- **Manual entry is slow**: Typing in every transaction takes time and motivation
- **Bank connections are risky**: Giving third-party apps your bank credentials is a security concern
- **Apps don't cover everything**: Some accounts (international, investment, crypto) don't connect to aggregators
- **Data entry falls behind**: Even with the best intentions, manual tracking becomes outdated

Delta offers a middle ground: easy data capture without connecting your accounts.

  <Card title="Screenshot parsing" icon="image">
    Take screenshots of your bank app, credit card statement, or investment account. Delta's AI extracts the transaction data automatically.

  <Card title="Auto-categorization" icon="tags">
    Transactions are automatically categorized based on merchant names. Over time, the system learns your categorization preferences.

## Technical architecture

Delta combines computer vision with traditional finance tracking:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Screenshot upload">
    Upload or paste screenshots from your banking apps, statements, or account pages. The system accepts various formats and layouts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Vision model processing">
    **Llama Vision Models** analyze the screenshot, extracting:
    - Transaction dates
    - Merchant/payee names
    - Amounts (debits and credits)
    - Account balances
    - Any other visible financial data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data extraction and structuring">
    The raw extracted text is parsed into structured transaction data. Amounts are normalized, dates are standardized, and merchants are identified.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Categorization">
    Transactions are auto-categorized based on merchant names. Categories include food, transportation, entertainment, utilities, and custom categories you define.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dashboard visualization">
    **Recharts** powers the visualization layer, showing spending trends, category breakdowns, and balance history over time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why screenshots?

The screenshot approach has several advantages:

<Accordion title="No credentials shared">
  You never give Delta access to your bank account. No usernames, passwords, or API connections. The only thing you share is images of your transactions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Works with any account">
  If you can see it on a screen, Delta can track it. International banks, investment platforms, crypto exchanges, even paper statements you photograph.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="You control the data">
  You decide what to share. Want to track only certain accounts? Only upload screenshots from those accounts. Privacy is built in.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Robust to changes">
  When banks update their APIs or aggregators lose access, screenshot parsing still works. The visual interface changes less frequently than underlying APIs.
</Accordion>

## Features

### Screenshot processing

The vision model handles various screenshot formats:

<Accordion title="Mobile banking apps">
  Screenshots from iOS or Android banking apps. The AI understands common layouts used by major banks.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Web banking portals">
  Screenshots from desktop banking websites, including transaction lists and account summaries.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Statements and documents">
  PDF statements or even photos of paper statements can be processed for transaction data.
</Accordion>

### Spending insights

Once data is in the system, Delta provides useful analysis:

<Accordion title="Category spending">
  See how much you're spending in each category over time. Identify areas where spending is higher than expected.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Trend analysis">
  Track spending patterns over weeks and months. See if you're spending more or less than usual.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Account balances">
  Keep track of balances across all your accounts in one view, without logging into each one separately.
</Accordion>

## Use cases

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Privacy-conscious tracking" icon="lock">
    Track finances without connecting accounts or sharing credentials with third-party services.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-platform accounts" icon="globe">
    Track accounts that don't integrate with standard aggregators - international banks, investment platforms, etc.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Occasional tracking" icon="calendar">
    Don't need real-time sync? Screenshot your accounts periodically for financial awareness without constant monitoring.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Expense reports" icon="receipt">
    Screenshot receipts and statements for expense tracking and reporting purposes.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Reflection

<Note>
Manually logging expenses is tedious - just screenshot your accounts and let AI do the rest. Delta makes finance tracking as easy as taking a screenshot.
</Note>

Delta explores a different approach to personal finance software. Rather than competing to connect to more banks or provide more real-time data, it focuses on making data entry effortless while maintaining user privacy and control.
