## Overview

<Info>
**Project**: LSClear  
**Status**: Completed  
**Repository**: [github.com/ehcaw/lsclear](https://github.com/ehcaw/lsclear)
</Info>

LSClear is a web-based Python IDE that runs in your browser with file persistence across sessions. It's designed for situations where you need to write and run Python code quickly without setting up a local environment - whether you're on a shared computer, teaching a class, or just want to prototype something without the overhead of a full development setup.

## What I built

LSClear provides a complete Python development experience in the browser, combining a professional code editor with server-side execution and persistent storage.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Monaco Editor" icon="code">
    The editing experience is powered by Monaco, the same editor that powers VS Code. This means syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and all the editing features developers expect.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Server-side execution" icon="play">
    Python code runs on a server (not in the browser via WASM), providing access to the full Python ecosystem including pip packages and system operations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="File persistence" icon="floppy-disk">
    Files are stored in a database and persist between sessions. Come back tomorrow and your code is still there, exactly as you left it.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Clean interface" icon="laptop">
    A smooth, modern interface built with Next.js that makes coding comfortable even for extended sessions.
  </Card>

## Technical architecture

The architecture of LSClear is designed to provide a smooth coding experience while handling the complexities of remote code execution:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Frontend with Monaco">
    The frontend is built with **Next.js** and integrates the **Monaco Editor** for the coding experience. Monaco provides the professional editing environment with features like syntax highlighting, error markers, and intelligent autocomplete.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Backend for execution">
    A **FastAPI** backend running on a **Digital Ocean** instance handles code execution. Code is received, executed in a controlled environment, and output is streamed back to the frontend.
  </Step>
  <Step title="API routing">
    **Cloudflare tunnels** provide clean API routing between the frontend and backend. This enables secure communication without exposing the backend server directly to the internet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Persistent storage">
    **NeonDB** (a serverless Postgres) stores user files persistently. Each user's files are isolated and available whenever they return to the application.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Technical stack

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Frontend" icon="desktop">
    - **Monaco Editor** for professional code editing
    - **Next.js** for the application framework
    - **React** for UI components
  </Card>
  <Card title="Backend" icon="server">
    - **FastAPI** for the API layer
    - **Digital Ocean** droplet for hosting
    - **Cloudflare tunnels** for routing
  </Card>
  <Card title="Storage" icon="database">
    - **NeonDB** for persistent file storage
    - Serverless Postgres for scalability
  </Card>

## Why server-side execution?

There are browser-based Python options that use WebAssembly (like Pyodide), but LSClear uses server-side execution for several reasons:

<Accordion title="Full Python ecosystem">
  Server-side execution provides access to the complete Python ecosystem. Install packages with pip, use system operations, access external APIs - everything works as expected.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Better performance for compute-heavy tasks">
  For anything computationally intensive, running on a server is significantly faster than running in a browser sandbox. This matters for data processing, ML experiments, or any serious computation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Consistent environment">
  Users don't need to worry about browser compatibility or client-side resources. The server provides a consistent, controlled environment where Python version and packages are known quantities.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Easier debugging">
  Server-side execution provides better error messages and debugging capabilities compared to WASM-based solutions, which often have limitations in how they can report errors.
</Accordion>

## Use cases

LSClear is useful in various scenarios:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Quick prototyping" icon="bolt">
    When you want to test an idea without setting up a project. Just open LSClear, write some code, and run it.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Shared computers" icon="users">
    On a computer where you can't install software. LSClear runs entirely in the browser with no local installation required.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Teaching" icon="graduation-cap">
    For instructors who want students to have immediate access to a Python environment without installation complexity.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Code sharing" icon="share">
    Quick way to share and run code snippets with colleagues without them needing any setup.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Security considerations

Running user-submitted code on a server requires careful security measures:

- **Sandboxed execution**: Code runs in an isolated environment that prevents access to the broader system
- **Resource limits**: Execution time and memory are limited to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Network isolation**: User code can't make arbitrary network connections from the server
- **User isolation**: Each user's files and execution environment are completely separate

## Reflection

<Note>
Sometimes you just want to code Python without setting up a whole environment. LSClear makes that possible - open a browser, write code, run it, and your files are there next time you come back.
</Note>

Building LSClear taught me about the challenges of remote code execution, the importance of security in user-facing applications, and how to create development tools that just work without requiring setup or configuration from users.
