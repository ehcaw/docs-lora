## The problem

Most AI code review tools have a frustrating limitation: they start fresh with every review. They don't remember that you explained a design decision yesterday, that a particular pattern is intentional, or that certain warnings have already been addressed. Every review feels like talking to someone with amnesia.

When I was helping manage code reviews for club repositories, I wanted a bot that could actually learn—one that builds context over time and provides increasingly relevant feedback.

## What I'm building

Toph Bot is a GitHub PR review bot that maintains persistent memory across reviews. Instead of analyzing each PR in isolation, it builds a knowledge base about:

- **Your codebase patterns** - Common idioms, architectural decisions, and coding standards
- **Previous discussions** - Past review comments and resolutions
- **Team preferences** - What kinds of issues matter most to your team

### How it works

The bot integrates directly with GitHub through webhooks:

1. **PR opened** - When a new PR is created, Toph Bot receives a webhook notification
2. **Context gathering** - The bot retrieves relevant context from its memory about the repository and author
3. **Intelligent review** - Using its accumulated knowledge, it provides targeted, contextual feedback
4. **Memory update** - After the review, new learnings are stored for future reference

### Planned features

The roadmap includes several exciting capabilities:

- **Codebase indexing** - Deep understanding of your repository's structure and patterns using RAG
- **Conversation continuity** - Remember ongoing discussions within a PR
- **Team learning** - Aggregate learnings across team members
- **Custom rules** - Define project-specific review criteria

## Why Letta for memory?

Letta is a framework specifically designed for building AI agents with persistent memory. Key benefits include:

- **Structured memory** - Organized storage of different types of information (facts, preferences, context)
- **Memory management** - Automatic summarization and prioritization of stored information
- **Context window optimization** - Intelligent selection of relevant memories for each interaction
- **Persistence** - Memory survives across sessions and deployments

## RAG for codebase understanding

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) allows the bot to understand your entire codebase:

1. **Indexing** - Code files are embedded and stored in a vector database
2. **Retrieval** - When reviewing a PR, relevant code context is retrieved
3. **Generation** - The LLM uses retrieved context to provide informed feedback

This approach means the bot understands:
- How similar code is written elsewhere in the repo
- Related functions and classes that might be affected
- Historical patterns and conventions

## Use cases

### Club repository management

The original motivation—helping manage reviews for student club projects:

- Consistent feedback even as reviewers change
- Institutional knowledge preserved across semesters
- New members can get up to speed faster

### Team code reviews

For professional teams looking to augment human review:

- Catch issues before human reviewers see them
- Enforce coding standards automatically
- Provide context for complex changes

### Personal projects

Even for solo developers:

- Remember decisions you made months ago
- Consistent code quality across long-running projects
- Quick feedback while human reviewers are unavailable

## Development status

Toph Bot is in active development. Current focus:

- Core webhook handling and GitHub integration
- Letta memory integration for context persistence
- Basic review capabilities with GPT-4
- Planning HelixDB integration for codebase RAG
