## The problem

I love Notion. It's an incredible tool for organizing thoughts, taking notes, and managing projects. But there's one thing I don't love: paying $10 per month for features I use daily. As a student and developer, subscription fatigue is real, and I started wondering—could I build something that does everything I need without the recurring cost?

## What I'm building

Pointer is a desktop note-taking application that aims to replicate the core Notion experience while adding AI features that are actually useful. The goal is to create a powerful, offline-first note-taking app that doesn't require a monthly subscription.

### Core features

The application includes all the essential note-taking features you'd expect:

- **Block-based editing** - Just like Notion, everything is a block. Text, headings, lists, code blocks, images—all modular and rearrangeable.
- **Rich text formatting** - Full markdown support with a WYSIWYG editor that makes formatting intuitive.
- **Databases** - Tables, kanban boards, and other structured data views for organizing information.
- **Pages and navigation** - Hierarchical page structure with a sidebar for easy navigation.
- **Cross-device sync** - Real-time synchronization between devices using Convex.

### AI enhancements

Beyond the basics, Pointer includes AI-powered features designed to enhance productivity:

- **Smart writing assistance** - AI suggestions that help you write more clearly and efficiently.
- **Content generation** - Generate outlines, summaries, and first drafts based on prompts.
- **Intelligent search** - Semantic search that understands what you're looking for, not just keyword matching.

### Quality of life features

Small touches that make daily use more pleasant:

- **Full markdown support** - Write in markdown and see it rendered beautifully.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - Power users can navigate and edit without touching the mouse.
- **Offline-first** - Works without an internet connection, syncing when connectivity is restored.
- **Native desktop app** - Fast startup, low resource usage, and OS integration.

## Why these technologies?

### Tiptap for the editor

Tiptap is built on ProseMirror, which provides a solid foundation for complex text editing. Unlike other editors, Tiptap is:

- **Headless** - Complete control over the UI and styling
- **Extensible** - Easy to add custom node types and functionality
- **Well-documented** - Comprehensive docs and active community

### Convex for real-time sync

Convex handles the complexity of real-time data synchronization:

- **Automatic syncing** - Changes propagate to all devices without manual refresh
- **Conflict resolution** - Built-in handling for concurrent edits
- **Serverless** - No infrastructure to manage

### Tauri for desktop

Tauri provides native desktop capabilities with a much smaller footprint than Electron:

- **Smaller bundle size** - Uses the system's native webview
- **Better performance** - Lower memory usage and faster startup
- **Rust backend** - Safe, fast native code when needed

## Development journey

Building a Notion clone is an ambitious project. Here's what I've learned so far:

1. **Rich text editing is hard** - There's a reason Notion took years to build. Handling edge cases in text editing—cursor positioning, selection, formatting—is surprisingly complex. I've spent more time than I expected debugging subtle issues with cursor behavior when switching between block types or handling nested lists. The ProseMirror architecture underlying Tiptap is powerful but has a steep learning curve.

2. **Real-time sync adds complexity** - Keeping multiple clients in sync while handling offline scenarios and conflicts requires careful architecture. Convex handles much of this complexity, but understanding the underlying concepts of operational transforms and conflict resolution has been essential for building a robust system.

3. **AI integration requires thought** - It's not enough to just add AI—the features need to be genuinely useful and not intrusive. I've iterated on the AI writing assistant multiple times, trying to find the right balance between being helpful and getting in the way. The goal is for AI features to feel like a natural extension of the writing experience, not a separate mode or distraction.

4. **Desktop apps have unique challenges** - Managing multiple windows, system tray integration, and native menus all require platform-specific considerations. Tauri abstracts much of this, but there are still edge cases around window management, file system access, and keyboard shortcuts that differ between macOS, Windows, and Linux.

5. **Performance matters for note-taking** - Users expect their notes to load instantly and editing to feel snappy. I've had to optimize database queries, implement lazy loading for large documents, and carefully manage memory usage to ensure the app remains responsive even with thousands of notes.

## Current status

Pointer is actively in development. Current focus areas include:

- Completing the core block types (tables, code blocks with syntax highlighting)
- Implementing the database features
- Refining the AI writing assistant
- Testing cross-platform builds (macOS, Windows, Linux)

<Tip>
  Building this to learn desktop development and because paying $10/month for notes feels ridiculous.
