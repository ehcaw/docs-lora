# Projects

I love building things. Whether it's a hackathon project completed in 24 hours or a side project I've been iterating on for months, each project represents an opportunity to learn something new and solve a problem I care about. Below you'll find a collection of my most notable projects, spanning AI tools, developer utilities, and more.

## Project philosophy

When I build projects, I focus on:

1. **Solving real problems** - Every project starts with a pain point I've experienced personally. If I'm frustrated by something, chances are others are too.

2. **Learning new technologies** - Projects are an excuse to explore new frameworks, languages, and paradigms in a context where I have complete creative control.

3. **Shipping quickly** - I'd rather have a working MVP that I can iterate on than a perfect design that never sees the light of day.

4. **Open source when possible** - Most of my projects are open source. I've learned so much from other developers' code, and I want to pay it forward.
