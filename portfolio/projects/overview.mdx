# Projects

I love building things. Whether it's a hackathon project completed in 24 hours or a side project I've been iterating on for months, each project represents an opportunity to learn something new and solve a problem I care about. I'm drawn to projects that scratch my own itch—tools I wish existed, problems that frustrated me, or technologies I wanted to understand better. Below you'll find a collection of my most notable projects, spanning AI tools, developer utilities, desktop applications, and more.

## Project philosophy

When I build projects, I focus on a set of principles that guide my decision-making from inception to deployment:

1. **Solving real problems** - Every project starts with a pain point I've experienced personally. If I'm frustrated by something, chances are others are too. This ensures that I'm motivated to finish the project and that the end result is something people actually want to use.

2. **Learning new technologies** - Projects are an excuse to explore new frameworks, languages, and paradigms in a context where I have complete creative control. I deliberately choose technologies that push me outside my comfort zone, whether that's learning Rust for desktop development or diving into AI agent frameworks.

3. **Shipping quickly** - I'd rather have a working MVP that I can iterate on than a perfect design that never sees the light of day. Perfectionism is the enemy of progress, and real user feedback is worth more than any amount of theoretical planning.

4. **Open source when possible** - Most of my projects are open source and available on my GitHub. I've learned so much from other developers' code, and I want to pay it forward. Open sourcing also holds me accountable for code quality and documentation.

5. **Building with AI augmentation** - I believe in AI as a tool for augmentation rather than replacement. Many of my projects explore how AI can enhance human capabilities—whether that's debugging assistance, documentation generation, or persistent memory for voice assistants.
