## The problem

Sometimes the terminal is all you need. You're SSHed into a server, working in a minimal environment, or just prefer keeping your hands on the keyboard. The terminal is fast, ubiquitous, and doesn't require a display server. But when you need AI assistance or want to quickly edit some code, you have to context-switch to a browser or GUI application, breaking your flow.

What if you could have an AI assistant and code editor without leaving the terminal? What if the same interface that lets you navigate your file system and run commands could also help you write and understand code?

## What I built

Shelly is a Terminal User Interface (TUI) application that combines:

- **AI chatbot** - Get help, ask questions, and have conversations directly in your terminal
- **Code editor** - Simple but functional text editing capabilities
- **AI agent features** - Basic agentic capabilities for code assistance

All packaged in a beautiful, responsive interface that runs anywhere you have a terminal.

## Features

### Chat interface

The chat panel provides a conversational interface to AI:

- **Natural language queries** - Ask questions in plain English
- **Code explanations** - Paste code and get explanations
- **Problem solving** - Describe issues and get suggestions
- **Persistent history** - Scroll through previous conversations

### Code editor

The integrated editor handles basic editing needs:

- **Syntax highlighting** - Language-aware coloring
- **Multiple files** - Switch between open files
- **Basic editing** - Insert, delete, copy, paste
- **File operations** - Save, load, create new files

### AI agent capabilities

Beyond simple chat, Shelly includes agent-like features:

- **Code suggestions** - Context-aware recommendations
- **Error analysis** - Paste error messages and get debugging help
- **Code generation** - Describe what you want and get code

### Why Textual?

Textual is a Python framework for building TUI applications with modern conveniences:

- **CSS-like styling** - Familiar approach to layout and theming
- **Widget system** - Composable UI components
- **Async support** - Non-blocking I/O for responsive interfaces
- **Cross-platform** - Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows

### Architecture

The application is structured around three main components:

1. **Chat panel** - Handles conversation display and input
2. **Editor panel** - Manages file editing and display
3. **AI service** - Coordinates with AI APIs and manages context

These components communicate through Textual's message system, allowing for loose coupling and easy testing.

## Design decisions

### Split-pane layout

The interface is divided into two panes:

- **Left pane** - Chat interface for AI interaction
- **Right pane** - Code editor for viewing and editing files

Users can resize the panes based on their current focus, and keyboard shortcuts make it easy to switch between them.

### Keyboard-first interaction

Every feature is accessible via keyboard:

- Navigation shortcuts for moving between panels
- Editing shortcuts matching common conventions
- Quick access to AI features without reaching for the mouse

### Minimal dependencies

The application keeps dependencies minimal for easy installation:

- Pure Python implementation
- Few external packages beyond Textual
- No native compilation required

## Use cases

### Remote development

When working on remote servers via SSH:

- Get AI assistance without opening a browser
- Edit configuration files with syntax highlighting
- Debug issues with AI-powered analysis

### Minimal environments

In resource-constrained settings:

- Low memory footprint compared to GUI applications
- Works over slow connections
- No display server required

### Terminal enthusiasts

For those who prefer command-line interfaces:

- Stay in the flow of terminal-based work
- Consistent interface with other terminal tools
- Customizable through configuration files

## Lessons learned

### TUI development is fun

Building terminal interfaces feels like going back to basics in a good way:

- Constraints breed creativity
- Character-based layouts are surprisingly capable
- There's satisfaction in making something work everywhere a terminal exists

### AI integration patterns

Integrating AI into interactive applications taught me:

- The importance of streaming responses for perceived responsiveness
- How to manage conversation context efficiently
- Balancing AI capabilities with interface simplicity

### Cross-platform challenges

Even terminal apps have platform differences:

- Key codes vary between terminals
- Unicode support is inconsistent
- Color capabilities differ
