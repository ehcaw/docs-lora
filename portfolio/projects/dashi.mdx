## Overview

Dashi is a desktop voice assistant that's basically a better Siri with actual memory. Built at CalHacks AI 2025, it's a voice assistant that remembers conversations and can use tools to actually do things - not just answer questions and forget everything immediately like traditional voice assistants.

## The problem with voice assistants

Current voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant have a fundamental limitation: they have no memory. Every interaction starts from scratch.

- **No context**: Ask a follow-up question and they don't remember the previous one
- **No personalization**: They don't learn your preferences over time
- **Limited actions**: Mostly just search and simple commands
- **No continuity**: Previous conversations are completely forgotten

Dashi addresses these issues by building on a persistent memory architecture.

## What I built

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Persistent memory" icon="brain">
    Powered by Letta agents, Dashi remembers previous conversations. Context carries forward, preferences are learned, and conversations can pick up where they left off.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Voice interface" icon="microphone">
    Groq Whisper provides fast, accurate speech-to-text conversion. Speak naturally and Dashi understands your requests.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Chat interface" icon="message">
    When you don't want to talk, use the clean chat interface instead. All the same capabilities, just typed instead of spoken.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tool support" icon="wrench">
    MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration allows Dashi to use external tools - search the web, manage files, access services, and more.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Technical architecture

Dashi combines several technologies to create a capable personal assistant:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Voice input with Whisper">
    **Groq Whisper** handles speech-to-text conversion with low latency. This is crucial for a voice assistant - slow transcription breaks the conversational flow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent framework with Letta">
    **Letta** provides the agent framework with persistent memory. Each conversation is stored and retrievable, allowing the assistant to reference past interactions and learn user preferences.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Desktop app with Tauri">
    **Tauri** wraps the application as a native desktop app. This enables system-level integration, persistent background operation, and quick access via keyboard shortcuts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tool integration with MCP">
    **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) enables tool use. Dashi can call external services like Exa for search, interact with local files, or connect to any MCP-compatible service.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key features

### Persistent memory

The memory capability is what makes Dashi fundamentally different from traditional voice assistants:

<Accordion title="Conversation continuity">
  Dashi remembers previous conversations. You can say "remember when I asked about that restaurant?" and it will know what you're talking about. Follow-up questions work naturally because context is preserved.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Preference learning">
  Over time, Dashi learns your preferences. If you consistently ask for certain types of information or prefer specific formats, the assistant adapts to serve you better.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Information recall">
  Tell Dashi something important and it remembers. "Remember I have a meeting with John next Tuesday" actually gets remembered and can be recalled later.
</Accordion>

### Tool capabilities

MCP integration allows Dashi to take actions, not just provide information:

<Accordion title="Web search with Exa">
  Search the web for current information. Unlike built-in assistant knowledge, this is real-time information from the internet.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Extensible tools">
  The MCP architecture means new tools can be added. Any MCP-compatible service can be connected, expanding what Dashi can do.
</Accordion>

### Dual interface

Use voice or text depending on the situation:

<Accordion title="Voice mode">
  Speak naturally to interact. Great for hands-free operation, quick questions, or when typing isn't convenient.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Chat mode">
  Type your requests in a chat interface. Better for complex queries, quiet environments, or when you need to include precise information.
</Accordion>

## Use cases

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Personal assistant" icon="user">
    A genuine personal assistant that knows your context, preferences, and history. More useful than starting from scratch each time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Research helper" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Ask questions, get answers, and build on previous queries. The assistant remembers what you've already explored.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Task management" icon="list-check">
    Tell Dashi about tasks and deadlines. It remembers them and can remind you or provide context when relevant.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Knowledge base" icon="book">
    Build up a personal knowledge base through conversations. Information you share is retained and can be recalled.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Hackathon context

<Note>
Siri forgets everything immediately - this one actually learns from our conversations. Built at CalHacks AI 2025 to explore what a memory-enabled voice assistant could be.
</Note>

Dashi was built to explore the question: what would a voice assistant be like if it actually remembered things? The answer turns out to be significantly more useful - the persistent memory transforms it from a search interface into something closer to an actual assistant.
