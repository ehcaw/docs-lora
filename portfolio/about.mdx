# About me

Hi! My name is **Ryan Nguyen** (known online as **wache**) and I'm currently studying computer science at San Jose State University. I'm deeply passionate about building technology that makes a meaningful impact on how developers work and how people interact with software. Whether it's shipping features at a fast-moving startup, hacking together projects at hackathons, or exploring new technologies in my spare time, I'm always looking for opportunities to learn, build, and create things that matter.

## What I'm interested in

I have a diverse range of interests that span both the technical and creative worlds:

- **Startups** - I'm fascinated by the startup ecosystem and the process of building products from the ground up. There's something incredibly rewarding about taking an idea from concept to reality, iterating quickly based on user feedback, and seeing real people use something you've created. The fast-paced, high-impact nature of startups resonates deeply with how I like to work.

- **AI augmentation** - I believe strongly in AI as a tool for augmentation rather than replacement. The most powerful applications of artificial intelligence are those that enhance human capabilities, making us more productive, creative, and effective at what we do. I'm interested in building AI-powered tools that amplify human potential rather than attempting to replace human judgment and creativity.

- **Developer tools** - As someone who spends a significant amount of time writing code, I have a deep appreciation for well-designed developer tools. I'm passionate about creating tools that improve the developer experience, reduce friction in common workflows, and help engineers focus on solving interesting problems rather than fighting with their tooling.

- **Photography** - Outside of coding, I enjoy photography as a creative outlet. It provides a wonderful balance to the analytical nature of software development and allows me to see the world from different perspectives.

- **Environmental impact** - I care deeply about sustainability and the environmental impact of the technology we build. I'm interested in how software can be used to address environmental challenges and how we can build more sustainable systems.

## My approach to building

I believe in shipping fast, learning from users, and iterating based on real feedback. This philosophy has guided me through startup work, hackathons, and personal projects alike. Whether I'm working on a side project or contributing to a larger team, I prioritize:

1. **Understanding the problem deeply** - Before writing any code, I invest time in understanding the real problem being solved and who will benefit from the solution. The best solutions come from deeply understanding the pain points that users face on a daily basis.

2. **Building with the user in mind** - Every technical decision should ultimately serve the people who will use what we build. I try to put myself in the user's shoes at every step of the development process, thinking about how they will interact with features and what will make their experience seamless and delightful.

3. **Shipping and iterating** - Perfect is the enemy of good. I'd rather get something functional in front of users quickly and improve it based on their feedback than spend months building in isolation. Real-world feedback is invaluable and often reveals insights that no amount of planning could have anticipated.

4. **Learning continuously** - Technology evolves rapidly, and I'm committed to constantly learning new skills, frameworks, and approaches. Every project is an opportunity to explore something new, whether it's a programming language, a framework, or an entirely new domain of knowledge.
