# About me

Hi! My name is **Ryan Nguyen** (known as **wache** online) and I'm currently studying computer science at San Jose State University. I'm deeply passionate about building technology that makes a meaningful impact on how developers work and how people interact with software. Whether it's shipping a new AI feature at a startup or hacking together a project at a weekend hackathon, I thrive on the process of creating tools and experiences that solve real problems for real people.

## What I'm interested in

I have a diverse range of interests that span both the technical and creative worlds, and these interests inform everything I build:

- **Startups** - I'm fascinated by the startup ecosystem and the process of building products from the ground up. There's something incredibly rewarding about taking an idea from concept to reality, iterating quickly based on user feedback, and seeing real people use something you've created. The fast-paced, high-impact nature of startups resonates deeply with how I like to work. I love the energy of small teams moving fast, the direct feedback loops with users, and the opportunity to wear many hats across product, engineering, and design.

- **AI augmentation** - I believe strongly in AI as a tool for augmentation rather than replacement. The most powerful applications of artificial intelligence are those that enhance human capabilities, making us more productive, creative, and effective at what we do. I'm interested in building AI-powered tools that amplify human potential rather than attempting to replace human judgment and creativity. This philosophy drives my work on projects like Dashi (a voice assistant with memory), Toph Bot (a code review bot that learns), and my day-to-day work building AI features at Mintlify.

- **Developer tools** - As someone who spends a significant amount of time writing code, I have a deep appreciation for well-designed developer tools. I'm passionate about creating tools that improve the developer experience, reduce friction in common workflows, and help engineers focus on solving interesting problems rather than fighting with their tooling. Great developer tools feel invisible—they just work and get out of your way. Projects like LSClear, Shelly, and CatDoc all stem from this passion.

- **Photography** - Outside of coding, I enjoy photography as a creative outlet. It provides a wonderful balance to the analytical nature of software development and allows me to see the world from different perspectives. There's something meditative about framing a shot and capturing a moment that complements the logical problem-solving I do in code.

- **Environmental impact** - I care deeply about sustainability and the environmental impact of the technology we build. I'm interested in how software can be used to address environmental challenges and how we can build more sustainable systems. This includes thinking about the energy footprint of AI systems, sustainable software practices, and using technology to solve climate-related problems.

## My approach to building

I believe in shipping fast, learning from users, and iterating based on real feedback. Whether I'm working on a side project or contributing to a larger team, I prioritize:

1. **Understanding the problem deeply** - Before writing any code, I invest time in understanding the real problem being solved and who will benefit from the solution. The best technical solutions come from deeply understanding the pain points users experience, not from assuming what they need. I talk to users, observe workflows, and dig into the "why" behind feature requests.

2. **Building with the user in mind** - Every technical decision should ultimately serve the people who will use what we build. This means thinking about UX implications of architectural choices, considering edge cases that real users will encounter, and always asking "how does this make the user's life better?"

3. **Shipping and iterating** - Perfect is the enemy of good. I'd rather get something functional in front of users quickly and improve it based on their feedback than spend months building in isolation. Hackathons have taught me the power of time constraints—you learn so much more by shipping something imperfect than by endlessly polishing something that never sees the light of day.

4. **Learning continuously** - Technology evolves rapidly, and I'm committed to constantly learning new skills, frameworks, and approaches. Every project is an opportunity to explore something new—whether that's a new framework like Tauri, a new paradigm like agentic AI, or a new domain like robotics.
