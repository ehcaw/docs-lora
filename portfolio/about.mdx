## Who I am

Hi! My name is **Ryan Nguyen** (wache online) and I'm currently studying computer science at San Jose State University. I'm a software engineer who believes in building technology that enhances human capabilities rather than replacing them, focusing on practical tools that solve real problems for developers and users alike.

My journey in software development has taken me from building robotics algorithms at hardware startups to developing AI-powered features at cutting-edge documentation platforms. I've worked across the full stack, from low-level motor control algorithms to modern web applications with sophisticated AI integrations. This diverse background gives me a unique perspective on how to build systems that are both technically sound and genuinely useful to their users.

## What drives me

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Startups" icon="rocket">
    I'm deeply interested in the startup ecosystem and the unique challenges and opportunities that come with building products from the ground up. There's something incredibly rewarding about shipping fast, wearing many hats, and seeing your work have an immediate impact on real users.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI augmentation" icon="brain">
    I believe in AI that augments human capabilities rather than replacing them entirely. My work focuses on building intelligent tools that make developers and users more productive, not tools that try to do everything for them. The best AI products feel like superpowers, not replacements.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Developer tools" icon="code">
    Building tools that help other developers be more productive is one of my favorite things to work on. Whether it's code review bots, documentation generators, or debugging utilities, I love creating software that makes the development experience better for everyone.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Environmental impact" icon="leaf">
    I care deeply about sustainability and how technology can be used to address environmental challenges. This shapes how I think about the products I build and the companies I choose to work with.

## Technical background

Over the years, I've built expertise across a wide range of technologies and domains. My work spans from low-level robotics algorithms using Python and NumPy to modern full-stack web applications with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. I have extensive experience with AI and machine learning integrations, including working with various LLM APIs, building RAG systems, and implementing memory-enabled agents.

<Accordion title="Languages and frameworks I work with">
  - **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Textual (Python TUI)
  - **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Node.js, Scala
  - **AI/ML**: Various LLM APIs (OpenAI, Groq, Gemini), Letta agents, RAG pipelines, Whisper STT, ElevenLabs TTS
  - **Databases**: Supabase, NeonDB, Redis, Upstash Vector, AWS Neptune
  - **Desktop**: Tauri (Rust)
  - **Cloud**: AWS (Lambda, S3, Neptune, Pipelines), Digital Ocean, Cloudflare
</Accordion>

## Get in touch

I'm always interested in connecting with people who share similar interests or are working on exciting projects. Whether you want to chat about new technologies, discuss startup ideas, or just have a conversation about anything at all, I'd love to hear from you.
