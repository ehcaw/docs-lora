Hi! My name is **Ryan Nguyen** (known as **wache** online) and I'm currently studying computer science at San Jose State University. I'm deeply passionate about building technology that makes a meaningful impact on how developers work and how people interact with software.

I believe strongly in shipping fast, learning from users, and iterating based on real feedback. Whether working on a side project or contributing to a larger team, I prioritize understanding the problem deeply, building with the user in mind, and constantly learning new skills, frameworks, and approaches as technology evolves rapidly.

## What I'm interested in

I have a diverse range of interests that span both the technical and creative worlds:

- **Startups** - I'm fascinated by the startup ecosystem and the process of building products from the ground up. There's something incredibly rewarding about taking an idea from concept to reality, iterating quickly based on user feedback, and seeing real people use something you've created. The fast-paced, high-impact nature of startups resonates deeply with how I like to work.

- **AI augmentation** - I believe strongly in AI as a tool for augmentation rather than replacement. The most powerful applications of artificial intelligence are those that enhance human capabilities, making us more productive, creative, and effective at what we do. I'm interested in building AI-powered tools that amplify human potential rather than attempting to replace human judgment and creativity.

- **Developer tools** - As someone who spends a significant amount of time writing code, I have a deep appreciation for well-designed developer tools. I'm passionate about creating tools that improve the developer experience, reduce friction in common workflows, and help engineers focus on solving interesting problems rather than fighting with their tooling.

- **Photography** - Outside of coding, I enjoy photography as a creative outlet. It provides a wonderful balance to the analytical nature of software development and allows me to see the world from different perspectives.

- **Environmental impact** - I care deeply about sustainability and the environmental impact of the technology we build. I'm interested in how software can be used to address environmental challenges and how we can build more sustainable systems.

## My approach to building

I believe in shipping fast, learning from users, and iterating based on real feedback. Whether I'm working on a side project or contributing to a larger team, I prioritize:

1. **Understanding the problem deeply** - Before writing any code, I invest time in understanding the real problem being solved and who will benefit from the solution.

2. **Building with the user in mind** - Every technical decision should ultimately serve the people who will use what we build.

3. **Shipping and iterating** - Perfect is the enemy of good. I'd rather get something functional in front of users quickly and improve it based on their feedback than spend months building in isolation.

4. **Learning continuously** - Technology evolves rapidly, and I'm committed to constantly learning new skills, frameworks, and approaches.
