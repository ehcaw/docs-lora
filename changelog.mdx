### Next.js upgrade and testing infrastructure

Upgraded Next.js and added comprehensive testing infrastructure across the codebase.

**Changes:**

- Upgraded Next.js to the latest version with Turbopack support for faster development builds
- Added Vitest testing framework with full coverage configuration
- Introduced comprehensive unit tests for:
  - Tiptap collaborative editor utilities
  - URL metadata fetching
  - Whiteboard utilities
  - Tree utilities and data structures
  - Highlight colors and general utilities
- Added Convex backend tests for note versioning and task management
- New test configuration files (`vitest.config.ts`, `vitest.convex.config.ts`)

**Why this matters:**

Testing infrastructure ensures code reliability as Pointer grows. The Next.js upgrade improves development speed with Turbopack while keeping the app on the latest stable release.
