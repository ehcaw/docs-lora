## Overview

Not all ideas are best expressed in words. Sometimes you need to sketch a diagram, draw a flowchart, map out a system architecture, or simply let your thoughts flow visually. Pointer's integrated whiteboard feature provides a powerful canvas for visual thinking, built on the open-source Excalidraw library that powers millions of diagrams worldwide.

The whiteboard in Pointer is not just an add-on—it's a first-class feature designed to complement your text-based notes with visual content. Whether you're brainstorming ideas, explaining complex systems, creating wireframes, or just doodling to spark creativity, the whiteboard gives you a flexible, intuitive space to work visually.

## Getting started with whiteboards

### Accessing your whiteboard

Each user has a personal whiteboard that persists across sessions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Whiteboard">
    Click on the Whiteboard option in the main navigation menu or sidebar. This takes you to your personal whiteboard canvas.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start creating">
    Your whiteboard opens with a blank canvas ready for use. The drawing tools are immediately available in the left toolbar.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Auto-save">
    Everything you draw is automatically saved. You can close your browser and return later to find your work exactly as you left it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

| Zoom to selection | `Shift + 2` |
| Reset zoom | `Ctrl/Cmd + 0` |

### Panning

## Whiteboard persistence

Pointer automatically manages whiteboard persistence so you never lose your work:

### How it works

1. Your whiteboard is stored as serialized Excalidraw data in Convex
2. Changes are auto-saved with debouncing (500ms after changes stop)
3. The full state is preserved including:
   - All elements and their properties
   - Canvas view state (zoom, position)
   - Selected elements
   - Collaboration state

### Data structure

The whiteboard is stored with the following fields:

```typescript
{
  title: string,           // Whiteboard name
  tenantId: string,        // Owner's user ID
  serializedData: string,  // Full Excalidraw state as JSON
  lastModified: string     // Timestamp of last change
}
```

## Tips and best practices

<Tip>
  **Use layers effectively:** Place background elements first, then build up layers. Use "Send to back" and "Bring to front" to manage element ordering.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Color coding:** Use consistent colors for different types of elements (e.g., blue for services, green for databases, red for warnings).
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Text labels:** Add text labels to shapes to make diagrams self-documenting. Use the text tool or click inside shapes to add embedded text.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Templates:** Create common elements once, then duplicate them (`Ctrl/Cmd + D`) to build consistent diagrams quickly.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Export options:** Excalidraw supports export to PNG, SVG, and JSON formats for sharing diagrams outside of Pointer.
