## Graph view overview

Pointer's graph view provides a visual representation of your notes and their relationships. Instead of navigating through a hierarchical folder structure, you can explore your knowledge as an interconnected network, discovering unexpected connections and patterns in your thinking.

## Accessing graph view

### Opening the graph

1. Click the graph icon in the sidebar
2. Or use keyboard shortcut `Cmd/Ctrl + G`
3. The graph opens in a new view

### Graph modes

The graph view supports several visualization modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Full graph** | All notes and connections |
| **Local graph** | Notes connected to current note |
| **Tag view** | Group notes by tags |
| **Timeline** | Notes arranged chronologically |

## Understanding the graph

### Nodes

Each node in the graph represents a note:

- **Size**: Based on connection count
- **Color**: Based on note type or custom tag
- **Label**: Note title (truncated if long)
- **Icon**: Indicates note type (file, folder, whiteboard)

### Edges

Connections between notes are shown as edges:

- **Links**: Explicit links between notes
- **Tags**: Notes sharing the same tags
- **Parent-child**: Hierarchical relationships
- **Semantic**: AI-detected similarity (planned)

### Visual encoding

```
Node size = number of connections
    ○ = few connections
    ● = many connections

Node color = note type or tag
    Blue = Regular note
    Green = Folder
    Purple = Whiteboard
    Custom = Tagged content

Edge thickness = connection strength
    ─ = single connection
    ━ = multiple connections
```

## Interacting with the graph

### Navigation

| Action | Method |
|--------|--------|
| **Pan** | Click and drag on background |
| **Zoom** | Scroll wheel or pinch |
| **Select node** | Click on a node |
| **Open note** | Double-click a node |
| **Multi-select** | Shift + click |

### Filtering

Narrow down what's displayed:

1. **By folder**: Show only notes in specific folders
2. **By tag**: Show only notes with certain tags
3. **By date**: Show notes from a time range
4. **By type**: Show only files, folders, or whiteboards

### Search in graph

Find specific notes:

1. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + F` in graph view
2. Type note name or content
3. Matching nodes highlight
4. Navigate between matches

## Graph features

### Clustering

The graph automatically groups related content:

- Notes with many connections cluster together
- Related topics form visible groups
- Outliers are positioned at the periphery

### Force simulation

The graph uses physics-based layout:

- **Attraction**: Connected nodes pull together
- **Repulsion**: Unconnected nodes push apart
- **Gravity**: Nodes pulled toward center
- **Collision**: Nodes don't overlap

### Interactive exploration

Discover your knowledge:

1. Hover over a node to highlight connections
2. Click to focus and see details
3. Drag nodes to rearrange
4. Use filters to explore subsets

## Tag explorer

### Viewing by tags

The tag explorer shows your content organized by tags:

```
Tags                    Notes
─────                   ─────
◉ work (12)     ──────▶ Meeting notes
◉ projects (8)  ──────▶ Project ideas
◉ ideas (15)    ──────▶ Random thoughts
◉ archive (23)  ──────▶ Old content
```

### Tag management

From the tag explorer:

- View all tags and counts
- Click to filter by tag
- See tag relationships
- Identify orphaned content

## Timeline view

### Chronological visualization

See your notes arranged by time:

```

```

### Timeline features

- **Zoom**: Focus on specific time periods
- **Filter**: Show certain note types
- **Activity**: See editing activity over time
- **Gaps**: Identify periods without notes

### Timeline interactions

| Action | Method |
|--------|--------|
| **Scroll** | Pan through time |
| **Zoom** | Pinch or scroll wheel |
| **Select** | Click on a note marker |
| **Open** | Double-click to open note |

## Search overlay

### Quick search

Access notes quickly from the graph:

1. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K` or `/`
2. Type to search
3. Results appear in overlay
4. Select to navigate to note

### Search features

- **Fuzzy matching**: Finds approximate matches
- **Content search**: Searches note contents
- **Title priority**: Titles ranked higher
- **Recent boost**: Recent notes appear first

## Capture modal

### Quick capture

Add notes without leaving the graph:

1. Press `N` or click the + button
2. Enter note content
3. Choose location (folder)
4. Note appears in graph

### Capture options

- **Title**: Required name for the note
- **Content**: Optional initial content
- **Location**: Folder to place the note
- **Tags**: Optional tags to apply

## Side panel

### Note preview

When you select a node:

- **Title**: Note name at top
- **Preview**: Content preview
- **Connections**: List of linked notes
- **Actions**: Edit, delete, share buttons

### Panel features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Preview** | See note content without opening |
| **Backlinks** | Notes that link to this one |
| **Outlinks** | Notes this links to |
| **Tags** | Applied tags |
| **Modified** | Last edit timestamp |

## Performance

### Large graphs

For large note collections:

- **Progressive loading**: Nodes load as needed
- **Level of detail**: Distant nodes simplify
- **Viewport culling**: Off-screen nodes skip rendering
- **Caching**: Positions cached between sessions

### Optimization tips

<Tip>
**Use filters**: Reduce visible nodes for better performance
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Local graph**: Start with local view for specific exploration
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Limit depth**: Reduce connection depth for faster rendering
</Tip>
