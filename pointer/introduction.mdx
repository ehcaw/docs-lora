## What is Pointer?

## Key features

Pointer offers a comprehensive suite of features designed to support every aspect of your note-taking and knowledge management workflow:

### Rich text editing with TipTap

At the heart of Pointer is a powerful rich text editor built on TipTap, providing a familiar and intuitive writing experience with advanced formatting capabilities. The editor supports a wide range of formatting options including headers, lists, code blocks with syntax highlighting, tables, images, links, and much more. The editor is highly extensible and customizable, allowing you to tailor your writing environment to your specific needs and preferences.

### Real-time collaboration with PartyKit

Pointer's real-time collaboration features are powered by PartyKit and Yjs, industry-leading technologies for building collaborative applications. Multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously with their changes appearing instantly for all participants. Presence indicators show you who else is viewing or editing a document, and conflict resolution is handled automatically so you never lose work or encounter merge conflicts.

### Visual whiteboards with Excalidraw

Sometimes the best way to capture an idea is to draw it. Pointer integrates Excalidraw, a powerful and intuitive whiteboard tool, directly into the application. Create diagrams, flowcharts, wireframes, mind maps, and freeform sketches alongside your notes. Whiteboard content is persisted automatically and can be accessed from anywhere.

### Hierarchical folder organization

Keep your notes organized with a flexible folder structure that supports unlimited nesting levels. Create folders and subfolders to mirror your mental model of your knowledge base. Move notes and folders between locations with drag-and-drop simplicity. The folder tree is always visible in the sidebar, making navigation quick and intuitive.

### Comprehensive task management

Stay on top of your to-dos with Pointer's integrated task management system. Create tasks with names, descriptions, categories, due dates, and tags. Mark tasks as complete, filter by category or status, and keep your work organized alongside your notes and documents.

### Version history and backups

Never worry about losing important changes. Pointer automatically creates version backups of your notes based on intelligent criteria, allowing you to review and restore previous versions of your documents when needed. The backup system is designed to capture meaningful changes without overwhelming you with trivial snapshots.

### Desktop application with Tauri

While Pointer works beautifully in any modern web browser, you can also install it as a native desktop application using Tauri. The desktop app provides a dedicated workspace for your notes with the full feature set of the web application plus native integrations and offline capabilities.
