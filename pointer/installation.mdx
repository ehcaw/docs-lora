## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with any installation method, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

### System requirements

| Requirement | Minimum | Recommended |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| Node.js | 20.x | Latest LTS |
| Package manager | npm 10+ | bun (latest) |
| RAM | 4 GB | 8 GB+ |
| Disk space | 2 GB | 5 GB+ |

### Required accounts and services

<Warning>
  Pointer requires several third-party services to function. You'll need to create accounts and obtain API keys from each of these providers before proceeding with the installation.
</Warning>

1. **Convex** - Backend database and real-time infrastructure
   - Create an account at [convex.dev](https://convex.dev)
   - Create a new project and note your deployment URL

2. **Clerk** - Authentication and user management
   - Create an account at [clerk.com](https://clerk.com)
   - Create a new application and configure your authentication providers
   - Note your publishable key and secret key

3. **PartyKit** - Real-time collaboration infrastructure
   - Create an account at [partykit.io](https://partykit.io)
   - Create a new project for your collaboration server

## Local development setup

Follow these steps to set up Pointer for local development:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    Start by cloning the Pointer repository from GitHub to your local machine:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ehcaw/pointer.git
    cd pointer
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Install all required dependencies using your preferred package manager. We recommend bun for faster installation:
    
    ```bash
    # Using bun (recommended)
    bun install
    
    # Using npm
    npm install
    ```
    
    This will install all frontend dependencies as well as development tools and testing utilities.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure environment variables">
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your service credentials:
    
    ```bash
    # Clerk Authentication
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxx
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxx
    
    # Convex Backend
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-project.convex.cloud
    
    # PartyKit Collaboration
    NEXT_PUBLIC_PARTYKIT_HOST=your-project.partykit.dev
    ```
    
    <Info>
      Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control. The repository includes a `.gitignore` entry to prevent accidental exposure of secrets.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Initialize Convex">
    Set up your Convex backend by running the initialization command:
    
    ```bash
    npx convex dev
    ```
    
    This command will:
    - Connect to your Convex project
    - Push the database schema defined in `convex/schema.ts`
    - Start watching for changes to your backend functions
    
    Keep this terminal open while developing—Convex will automatically sync your backend changes.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start the development server">
    In a new terminal window, start the Next.js development server with Turbopack for fast refresh:
    
    ```bash
    # Using bun
    bun dev
    
    # Using npm
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. The development server supports hot module replacement, so changes to your code will appear instantly without requiring a full page reload.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start the PartyKit server (optional)">
    For real-time collaboration features, you'll also need to run the PartyKit server:
    
    ```bash
    npx partykit dev
    ```
    
    This starts a local PartyKit server that handles real-time synchronization between collaborators.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Development commands

The Pointer repository includes several useful commands for development:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `bun dev` | Start Next.js development server with Turbopack |
| `bun build` | Build the application for production |
| `bun start` | Start the production server |
| `bun lint` | Run ESLint to check for code quality issues |
| `bun test` | Run the test suite with Vitest |
| `bun test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode during development |
| `bun test:coverage` | Generate test coverage report |
| `bun test:convex` | Run Convex backend tests specifically |
| `bun test:all` | Run all tests including frontend and backend |

## Building the desktop application

Pointer includes a Tauri-based desktop application that provides a native experience with potential offline capabilities. Follow these steps to build it:

### Additional prerequisites for Tauri

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    Install Xcode Command Line Tools:
    
    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    Install the following:
    - [Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
    - [WebView2](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linux">
    Install required system libraries:
    
    ```bash
    # Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev build-essential curl wget file libssl-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev
    
    # Fedora
    sudo dnf install webkit2gtk4.1-devel openssl-devel curl wget file libappindicator-gtk3-devel librsvg2-devel
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Install Rust

Tauri requires Rust to build the native application wrapper:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

After installation, restart your terminal and verify:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

### Build the desktop app

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Tauri CLI">
    The Tauri CLI is included in the project's dev dependencies, but you can also install it globally:
    
    ```bash
    cargo install tauri-cli
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Build the application">
    Run the Tauri build command to compile the desktop application:
    
    ```bash
    # Development build
    cargo tauri dev
    
    # Production build
    cargo tauri build
    ```
    
    The production build will create distributable binaries in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run the desktop app">
    For development, `cargo tauri dev` will automatically launch the application with hot reload enabled.
    
    For production builds, find the installer or executable in the bundle directory appropriate for your platform.
  </Step>
</Steps>

    If you're seeing connection errors with Convex:
    
    1. Verify your `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` is correct in `.env.local`
    2. Ensure you've run `npx convex dev` and it's still running
    3. Check that your Convex project is not paused in the dashboard
    4. Try restarting both the Convex dev process and the Next.js server
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Clerk authentication issues">
    If authentication isn't working:
    
    1. Double-check both Clerk environment variables are set correctly
    2. Verify your Clerk application configuration includes the correct redirect URLs
    3. Clear browser cookies and try signing in again
    4. Check the Clerk dashboard for any error logs
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="PartyKit connection failures">
    If real-time collaboration isn't syncing:
