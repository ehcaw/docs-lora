## Overview

I've had the privilege of working at companies ranging from startups to tech giants, each experience teaching me valuable lessons about software engineering, collaboration, and building products that matter. My journey has taken me from robotics internships to full-stack development roles to backend AI engineering at a developer tools startup.

## Philosophy

I approach my work with a few core principles:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ship fast, iterate faster">
    Get working software in front of users quickly, then improve based on real feedback. Perfect is the enemy of good, and good software that ships beats perfect software that doesn't.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Understand the problem deeply">
    Before writing code, make sure you truly understand the problem you're solving. Talk to users, study the domain, and question assumptions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build for maintainability">
    Code is read more than it's written. Write clean, well-documented code that your future self (and your teammates) will thank you for.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Always be learning">
    The field of software engineering moves fast. Stay curious, explore new technologies, and never stop growing your skills.
  </Step>
</Steps>
