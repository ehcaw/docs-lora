As a Full-Stack Developer at The Tutoring Center, I was responsible for developing and maintaining web applications that helped the organization manage tutoring sessions, track student progress, and streamline administrative operations. This role gave me my first deep experience working directly with customers and stakeholders to understand their needs and translate them into working software.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Technologies used

The tech stack was modern and focused on developer productivity:

```typescript
const techStack = {
  frontend: {
    framework: 'Next.js',
    library: 'React',
    language: 'TypeScript'
  },
  backend: {
    database: 'Supabase',
    auth: 'Supabase Auth',
    storage: 'Supabase Storage'
  }
};
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Next.js and React">
    The frontend was built with Next.js and React, taking advantage of server-side rendering for performance and SEO, and React's component model for building reusable UI elements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="TypeScript">
    TypeScript provided the type safety and developer experience improvements that made working on a growing codebase manageable and enjoyable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Supabase">
    Supabase served as our backend-as-a-service, providing a PostgreSQL database, authentication, real-time subscriptions, and file storage - all the backend functionality we needed without managing our own infrastructure.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Key features I built

Some of the key features I developed include:

- **Session management**: A system for scheduling, tracking, and managing tutoring sessions
- **Student records**: A comprehensive system for maintaining student information and tracking their progress over time
- **Reporting dashboards**: Administrative dashboards that gave management visibility into tutoring operations
- **Communication tools**: Features to facilitate communication between tutors, students, and parents

## Key learnings

This role was transformative for my understanding of software development:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer empathy is everything">
    This was my first experience working so intimately with customers. I learned that understanding customer needs, pain points, and workflows is just as important as technical skills. You can build the most technically impressive software, but if it doesn't solve real problems in ways users can actually use, it's worthless.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Requirements are a conversation">
    Customers often know what problems they have but not what solutions they need. Learning to ask the right questions and translate vague requirements into concrete features was an invaluable skill.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Simplicity wins">
    The best solutions are often the simplest ones. Users don't want complex features - they want their problems solved with the least friction possible.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Feedback loops matter">
    Regular feedback from users helped us iterate quickly and avoid building features that missed the mark. Short feedback loops are essential for building products people actually want.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Impact

<Note>
  This role taught me how to develop with customer needs and pain points in mind. The skills I learned about stakeholder collaboration and user-focused development have been invaluable in every role since.
</Note>

Working at The Tutoring Center showed me that great software isn't just about code - it's about understanding people, their problems, and building solutions that genuinely help them.
