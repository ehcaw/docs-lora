## Technologies I work with

At Mintlify, I work with a modern tech stack designed for building scalable, AI-powered applications:

```typescript
const techStack = {
  languages: ['TypeScript', 'Go'],
  focus: ['AI/ML frameworks', 'LLM integrations'],
  infrastructure: ['Backend APIs', 'Cloud services']
};
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="TypeScript">
    TypeScript is my primary language for building features across the stack. Its type safety and excellent tooling make it ideal for building reliable, maintainable applications at scale.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Go">
    Go is used for performance-critical backend services where speed and efficiency matter. Its simplicity and excellent concurrency support make it perfect for building scalable infrastructure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AI/ML frameworks and LLM integrations">
    A core part of my work involves integrating large language models and AI capabilities into the product. This includes working with various AI providers, building intelligent features, and ensuring AI responses are accurate and helpful.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Backend infrastructure and APIs">
    I design and implement APIs that power the platform, ensuring they're well-documented, performant, and easy to use.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Why I love this role

Working at Mintlify has been an incredible experience for several reasons:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Startup velocity">
    At a startup, you ship fast and see your work in users' hands quickly. There's no waiting months for features to go through endless review cycles - you build it, ship it, and iterate based on real feedback.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wearing many hats">
    In a small team, you get to work on everything from infrastructure to AI features to user-facing improvements. This variety keeps things interesting and helps you grow as an engineer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Real impact">
    The AI features I build are used by developers every day. There's nothing quite like seeing your work help real people solve real problems.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dev tools passion">
    Working on developer tools means building software for people like me - engineers who appreciate good tooling and thoughtful design. It's deeply satisfying work.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key learnings

<Note>
  Working at a dev tools startup has taught me that the best products are built with deep empathy for users. When you're building for developers, you need to understand their workflows, frustrations, and goals intimately.
</Note>

Some of the most important things I've learned in this role:

- **AI is a tool, not magic**: Building effective AI features requires understanding both what AI can do well and where it falls short. The best AI features augment human capabilities rather than trying to replace them entirely.
- **Documentation matters**: Working at a documentation company has given me a deep appreciation for the importance of good docs. Clear, well-organized documentation can make or break a developer's experience with a product.
- **Move fast, but don't break things**: Shipping quickly is important, but so is reliability. Finding the right balance between speed and stability is crucial.
- **User feedback is gold**: The fastest path to building great products is talking to users, understanding their pain points, and iterating based on their feedback.
