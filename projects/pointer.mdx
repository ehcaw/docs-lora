## Overview

<Info>
  **Project type**: Personal project (in development)  
  **GitHub**: [github.com/ehcaw/pointer](https://github.com/ehcaw/pointer)
</Info>

Pointer is a desktop note-taking application that does everything Notion does but with better AI features and no subscription fees. I'm building it because I love Notion's functionality but don't want to pay $10/month for notes - and because I wanted to learn desktop development with Tauri.

## The problem

Notion is an incredible productivity tool, but:

- **It's expensive**: Notion Pro costs $10/month for features that feel like they should be free
- **AI features are limited**: The AI capabilities feel bolted on rather than deeply integrated
- **It's not truly offline**: While Notion has offline support, it's clearly designed as a web-first app
- **Vendor lock-in**: Your notes live on Notion's servers, making migration difficult

## What I'm building

A desktop note-taking app that combines the best of Notion's organizational capabilities with deeply integrated AI features:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Block-based editor" icon="cube">
    All the familiar Notion building blocks - paragraphs, headings, lists, databases, embeds, and more. Built with Tiptap for a smooth editing experience.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Real-time sync" icon="cloud">
    Seamless synchronization across all your devices using Convex, so your notes are always up to date no matter where you access them.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI writing assistance" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    AI features that are actually useful - smart suggestions, content generation, summarization, and more, powered by the Vercel AI SDK.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Native desktop experience" icon="desktop">
    Wrapped in Tauri for a true desktop experience with fast startup, native menus, keyboard shortcuts, and offline support.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Technical architecture

The application is built with a modern stack designed for performance and developer productivity:

```typescript
const architecture = {
  frontend: {
    framework: 'Next.js',
    editor: 'Tiptap',
    styling: 'Tailwind CSS',
    language: 'TypeScript'
  },
  backend: {
    database: 'Convex',
    sync: 'Convex real-time'
  },
  desktop: {
    wrapper: 'Tauri (Rust)'
  },
  ai: {
    sdk: 'Vercel AI SDK'
  }
};
```

### Why these technologies?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tiptap for the editor">
    Tiptap is a headless rich-text editor built on ProseMirror. It gives me complete control over the editing experience while handling all the complex text editing logic. The block-based architecture maps perfectly to Notion's content model.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Next.js for the web frontend">
    Next.js provides the foundation for the web-based UI that Tauri wraps. Server components, API routes, and the excellent developer experience make it ideal for building complex applications quickly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Convex for real-time sync">
    Convex handles all the real-time synchronization between devices. Instead of building a custom sync engine, I can rely on Convex's conflict resolution and real-time capabilities.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tauri for desktop">
    Tauri wraps the web app in a native desktop shell, providing access to native APIs while keeping the bundle size small (much smaller than Electron). The Rust backend also enables performance-critical operations when needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Vercel AI SDK for AI features">
    The Vercel AI SDK provides a consistent interface for working with various AI providers. This lets me build AI features without being locked into a single provider and makes it easy to swap models as better options become available.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Features in development

I'm building out the following capabilities:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Core note-taking">
    Basic block types (paragraphs, headings, lists, code blocks), page hierarchy, and rich text formatting. This is the foundation everything else builds on.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Databases">
    Table, board, and list views for structured data - one of Notion's most powerful features that I want to replicate and improve.
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI assistance">
    Smart writing suggestions, content generation, summarization of long notes, and intelligent search across all your content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Quality of life features">
    Markdown support for fast input, comprehensive keyboard shortcuts, templates, and quick capture functionality.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why I'm building this

Beyond not wanting to pay for Notion, this project is teaching me:

- **Desktop development**: Learning Tauri and the differences between web and desktop app development
- **Complex state management**: Handling real-time sync and conflict resolution
- **Editor internals**: Understanding how rich-text editors work under the hood
- **AI integration**: Building AI features that feel native rather than bolted on

<Note>
  Building this to learn desktop development and because paying $10/month for notes feels ridiculous. Follow progress on [GitHub](https://github.com/ehcaw/pointer).
