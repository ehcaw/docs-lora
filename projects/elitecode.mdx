## Overview

<Info>
  **Project type**: Hackathon project (SFHacks 2023)  
  **GitHub**: [github.com/ehcaw/sfhacks](https://github.com/ehcaw/sfhacks)
</Info>

EliteCode is a web application for practicing the verbal part of coding interviews. You explain your solution out loud, and AI gives you feedback on your explanation - helping you practice the communication skills that are just as important as coding skills in technical interviews.

## The problem

Coding interviews test two things:

1. **Can you code?** - Solve the problem correctly
2. **Can you communicate?** - Explain your thinking clearly

Most interview prep focuses on #1. LeetCode, HackerRank, and similar platforms help you practice solving problems. But where do you practice explaining your solutions?

The communication part trips up a lot of candidates:

- **Thinking out loud** is awkward and unnatural
- **Explaining while coding** requires multitasking
- **Articulating tradeoffs** needs practice
- **Handling questions** is a skill you develop through repetition

## What I built

A voice-first platform for practicing interview communication:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Speech-to-text" icon="microphone">
    Explain your solution by talking - Whisper transcribes your explanation accurately.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI analysis" icon="brain">
    OpenAI analyzes your explanation for clarity, completeness, and technical accuracy.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Voice feedback" icon="volume-high">
    Get feedback through ElevenLabs text-to-speech, like having a mock interviewer respond.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Practice problems" icon="code">
    A library of coding problems to practice explaining.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Technical architecture

```typescript
const eliteCodePipeline = {
  // 1. Capture voice input
  input: {
    method: 'browser microphone',
    transcription: 'Whisper'
  },
  
  // 2. Analyze explanation
  analysis: {
    model: 'OpenAI 3.5 Turbo',
    criteria: [
      'clarity',
      'completeness',
      'technical accuracy',
      'communication style'
    ]
  },
  
  // 3. Deliver feedback
  output: {
    text: 'on-screen feedback',
    voice: 'ElevenLabs TTS'
  }
};
```

### Technologies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Next.js">
    The web application is built with Next.js, providing a clean interface for selecting problems, recording explanations, and reviewing feedback.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Whisper">
    OpenAI's Whisper model handles speech-to-text transcription, converting your verbal explanation into text that can be analyzed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="OpenAI 3.5 Turbo">
    GPT-3.5 Turbo analyzes your transcribed explanation, checking for clarity, technical accuracy, and completeness.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="ElevenLabs">
    ElevenLabs converts the AI's feedback into natural-sounding speech, making the experience feel more like an actual mock interview.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Features

### Voice-based practice

The core workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a problem">
    Choose a coding problem from the library - classic interview questions like "Two Sum", "Valid Parentheses", etc.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explain your approach">
    Hit record and explain how you would solve the problem, just like you would in an actual interview.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get transcription">
    Whisper transcribes your explanation into text for analysis.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive feedback">
    The AI analyzes your explanation and provides specific feedback on how to improve.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Hear the response">
    ElevenLabs reads the feedback aloud, simulating interviewer feedback.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Feedback categories

EliteCode evaluates explanations on several dimensions:

| Category | What it checks |
|----------|----------------|
| Clarity | Is the explanation easy to follow? |
| Completeness | Did you cover all the key points? |
| Technical accuracy | Is your solution correct? |
| Time/space complexity | Did you analyze efficiency? |
| Edge cases | Did you consider boundary conditions? |
| Communication style | How natural and confident do you sound? |

### Practice modes

- **Explanation mode**: Explain a solution you already know
- **Thinking aloud mode**: Work through a problem while talking
- **Q&A mode**: Answer follow-up questions about your solution

## Why voice matters

Text-based interview prep misses a crucial element: the actual communication experience. There's a big difference between:

- Knowing the answer in your head
- Writing it down
- Explaining it verbally while someone watches

EliteCode helps bridge that gap by forcing you to practice the verbal part - the part that actually happens in the interview.

## SFHacks 2023

Built at SFHacks 2023, EliteCode came from our shared frustration preparing for technical interviews. We were all good at LeetCode but felt unprepared for the verbal explanation part of interviews.

The hackathon format was perfect for this project - we had a clear problem, a straightforward solution, and the right APIs to make it work in 24 hours.

<Note>
  Coding interviews are hard enough without fumbling through explanations - EliteCode helps you practice the talking part so you can focus on the coding part when it counts.
