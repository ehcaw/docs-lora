## Overview

<Info>
  **Project type**: Personal project  
  **GitHub**: [github.com/ehcaw/shelly](https://github.com/ehcaw/shelly)
</Info>

Shelly is a TUI (Terminal User Interface) application that combines a chatbot with a simple code editor, all running in your terminal. It's built for developers who live in the terminal and want AI assistance without leaving their command-line workflow.

## The problem

Modern AI coding assistants are great, but they usually require:

- Opening a browser or separate app
- Context switching away from your terminal
- Copy-pasting code back and forth
- Dealing with GUI interfaces that don't fit your workflow

For developers who spend most of their time in the terminal, this context switching is disruptive and inefficient.

## What I built

A terminal application that brings AI assistance directly into your command-line environment:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="TUI chat interface" icon="message">
    A full-featured chat interface built with Textual that looks and feels native to the terminal, with syntax highlighting for code responses.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Integrated code editor" icon="file-code">
    A simple but functional code editor within the TUI - write, edit, and test code without leaving the terminal.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI agent capabilities" icon="robot">
    Basic AI agent features for code assistance - the bot can understand your code context and provide relevant suggestions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Terminal-native experience" icon="terminal">
    Designed to feel like a natural part of your terminal workflow, with keyboard-driven navigation and familiar keybindings.
  </Card>

## Technical implementation

Shelly is built entirely in Python using the Textual framework:

```python
# Simplified structure of Shelly
from textual.app import App
from textual.widgets import Header, Footer, Input, TextArea

class ShellyApp(App):
    """A terminal-based AI assistant and code editor."""
    
    def compose(self):
        yield Header()
        yield ChatPanel()      # AI conversation interface
        yield CodeEditor()     # Built-in code editing
        yield Footer()
    
    async def on_user_message(self, message):
        # Send to AI with code context
        context = self.code_editor.get_content()
        response = await self.ai_agent.respond(message, context)
        self.chat_panel.display(response)
```

### Technologies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Textual">
    Textual is a Python framework for building terminal user interfaces. It provides a React-like development experience for the terminal, with widgets, layouts, and event handling that make building complex TUIs manageable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AI APIs">
    Shelly integrates with various AI providers for the agent features. The abstraction layer makes it easy to switch between providers or use local models.

## Features

### Chat interface

The chat panel provides a full conversation interface:

- **Syntax highlighting**: Code in AI responses is properly highlighted
- **Message history**: Scroll through previous messages
- **Context awareness**: The AI understands code you're working on in the editor

### Code editor

The integrated editor supports:

- **Syntax highlighting**: For major programming languages
- **Basic editing**: Cut, copy, paste, undo, redo
- **File operations**: Open, save, and create files
- **Code execution**: Run code directly from the editor

### AI agent features

The AI assistant can:

- **Answer questions**: About code, APIs, best practices
- **Explain code**: Break down complex logic
- **Suggest improvements**: Based on what you're working on
- **Generate code**: From natural language descriptions

## Philosophy

Shelly is built on the belief that sometimes the terminal is all you need. Not every task requires a full IDE with hundreds of features. For quick coding sessions, experiments, or working on remote servers, a terminal-native solution can be faster and more focused.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Minimal context switching">
    Stay in the terminal where you're already working. No browser, no GUI app, just your terminal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Keyboard-first">
    Everything is accessible via keyboard shortcuts. Your hands never leave the keyboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Lightweight">
    Starts instantly, uses minimal resources, and works over SSH.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Focused">
    Does a few things well rather than trying to be a full IDE.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Use cases

Shelly is ideal for:

- **Remote development**: SSH into a server and get AI assistance
- **Quick scripts**: Write and test code without opening an IDE
- **Learning**: Interactive coding with AI explanations
- **Terminal workflows**: When you're already in the terminal and don't want to switch contexts

<Note>
  Sometimes the terminal is all you need - I wanted to see how much I could fit into a TUI while keeping it fast and focused.
