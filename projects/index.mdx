## Overview

I love building things. Whether it's a hackathon project built in 24 hours or a personal tool I've been refining for months, each project teaches me something new and (hopefully) solves a real problem. Below you'll find a collection of my projects - from AI-powered debugging tools to desktop apps to documentation generators.

## Featured projects

## Project philosophy

When I build projects, I try to follow a few principles:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Solve real problems">
    The best projects come from real frustrations. Pointer exists because I didn't want to pay for Notion. Documix exists because searching through documentation is painful. If I'm not solving a problem I actually have, I'm probably building the wrong thing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Learn something new">
    Each project should teach me something I didn't know before - a new framework, a new paradigm, a new domain. Projects are as much about learning as they are about building.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ship something usable">
    A half-finished project teaches you less than a finished one. Even if it's rough around the edges, shipping something you can actually use forces you to think through all the details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Have fun">
    If I'm not enjoying the project, I won't finish it. Life's too short to build things that bore you.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Hackathon projects

Several of my projects were born at hackathons, where the time pressure forces you to focus on what matters most:

| Project | Hackathon | What I built |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| [Dashi](/projects/dashi) | CalHacks AI 2025 | Voice assistant with persistent memory |
| [CatDoc](/projects/catdoc) | HackDavis 2025 | AI documentation generator |
| [EliteCode](/projects/elitecode) | SFHacks 2023 | Coding interview practice with voice |
