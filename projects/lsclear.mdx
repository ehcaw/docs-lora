## Overview

<Info>
  **Project type**: Personal project  
  **GitHub**: [github.com/ehcaw/lsclear](https://github.com/ehcaw/lsclear)
</Info>

LSClear is a full Python development environment that runs entirely in your browser. No installation required - just open the URL and start coding. Your files persist across sessions, so you can close the tab and come back to your code later.

## The problem

Sometimes you just want to write some Python code without:

- Installing Python on a new machine
- Setting up a virtual environment
- Configuring VS Code or another IDE
- Worrying about conflicting dependencies

Maybe you're on a borrowed computer, maybe you're testing something quick, or maybe you just don't want to clutter your local machine. For these situations, you need a browser-based solution that actually works well.

## What I built

A complete browser-based Python development environment:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Monaco Editor" icon="code">
    The same editor that powers VS Code, giving you syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and all the editing features you expect from a modern IDE.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Real code execution" icon="play">
    Your Python code runs on a real server (not a limited browser sandbox), so you can use any Python library and do real work.
  </Card>
  <Card title="File persistence" icon="hard-drive">
    Your files are stored in NeonDB and persist across sessions. Come back tomorrow and your code is still there.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Clean interface" icon="browser">
    A simple, distraction-free interface built with Next.js that focuses on what matters - writing code.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Technical architecture

The system consists of three main components:

```typescript
const architecture = {
  frontend: {
    framework: 'Next.js',
    editor: 'Monaco Editor',
    purpose: 'IDE interface'
  },
  backend: {
    framework: 'FastAPI',
    hosting: 'Digital Ocean',
    purpose: 'Code execution'
  },
  storage: {
    database: 'NeonDB',
    purpose: 'File persistence'
  },
  networking: {
    tunnels: 'Cloudflare',
    purpose: 'Clean API routing'
  }
};
```

### How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Write code in the browser">
    The Monaco Editor provides a familiar coding experience with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and all the features you'd expect from VS Code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute on the server">
    When you run your code, it's sent to a FastAPI server running on Digital Ocean. The server executes your Python code in a controlled environment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Return results">
    Output, errors, and any generated files are sent back to the browser and displayed in the terminal panel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Persist files">
    Your code is automatically saved to NeonDB, associated with your session, so you can close the browser and come back later.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Technologies explained

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Monaco Editor">
    Monaco is the editor component that powers VS Code. It provides syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, error detection, and a polished editing experience that makes coding in the browser feel natural.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Next.js">
    Next.js provides the foundation for the web application, handling routing, server-side rendering, and API endpoints for communicating with the execution backend.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="FastAPI">
    The Python execution server is built with FastAPI, which handles code execution requests efficiently. The async nature of FastAPI makes it well-suited for handling multiple concurrent execution requests.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Digital Ocean">
    The FastAPI server runs on a Digital Ocean droplet, providing a reliable execution environment for user code. Sandboxing ensures user code can't affect the host system.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cloudflare tunnels">
    Cloudflare tunnels provide clean, secure routing to the execution API without exposing the Digital Ocean server directly to the internet.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="NeonDB">
    NeonDB (serverless Postgres) stores user files and sessions. Its serverless nature means I don't have to manage database infrastructure while getting the reliability of Postgres.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security considerations

Running arbitrary user code is inherently risky. LSClear implements several protections:

- **Sandboxed execution**: User code runs in isolated environments that can't affect other users or the host system
- **Resource limits**: CPU, memory, and execution time are limited to prevent runaway code
- **Network restrictions**: Outbound network access is controlled to prevent abuse
- **Session isolation**: Each user's files and execution environment are completely separate

## Use cases

LSClear is perfect for:

- **Quick scripts**: Test an idea without setting up a local environment
- **Learning**: Practice Python without any installation barriers
- **Sharing**: Share code that others can run instantly in their browser
- **Borrowed machines**: Code on computers where you can't install software

<Note>
  Sometimes you just want to code Python without setting up a whole environment. LSClear makes that possible - just open the URL and start writing code.
